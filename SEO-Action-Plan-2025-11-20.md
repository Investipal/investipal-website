### **Additional SEO Element Improvements**

#### **URL Structure Optimization**

**Current Issues:**
- URLs are too long

- Not keyword-optimized

**Examples:**

```
❌ Current: /blog-posts/ai-driven-portfolio-optimization-how-transparent-explainable-ai-is-shaping-the-future-of-wealth-management

✅ Better: /blog/ai-portfolio-management-2025-guide

❌ Current: /blog-posts/regulation-best-interest-reg-bi-what-financial-advisors-and-broker-dealers-need-to-know

✅ Better: /blog/reg-bi-compliance-guide-2025
```

**Action:** For new posts, use short, keyword-rich URLs

---

```

```
❌ Bad: "screenshot-1.png"
