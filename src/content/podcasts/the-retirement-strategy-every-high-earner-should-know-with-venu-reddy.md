We dive deep into <strong id="">cash balance plans (CBPs)</strong> and how they compare to 401(k)s and IRAs, when they make sense, and how advisors can use them to grow AUM while adding real value to clients. Venu also shares two compelling case studies—one where a CBP worked extremely well, and one where it didn’t—and the lessons learned from each.</p><p id="">Please enjoy our conversation with Venu Reddy.</p>
