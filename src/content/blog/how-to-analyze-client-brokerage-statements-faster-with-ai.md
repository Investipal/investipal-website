<p id="">For financial advisors, analyzing portfolio holdings is an essential part of delivering value to clients. However, manually extracting and analyzing data from brokerage account statements and other documents can be time-consuming and tedious. This manual process can leave less time for higher-level strategic planning and client interactions.</p><p id="">The good news? Automation tools, like Investipal's <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/intelligent-document-processing/">IDP (Intelligent Document Processing)</a> solution, can significantly speed up this process. Combining Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the IDP tool helps advisors quickly scan, interpret, and analyze portfolio data from various document formats.</p><p id="">In this post, we’ll explore how Investipal’s IDP can help financial advisors analyze portfolio holdings faster and more accurately, so they can focus on what matters most—providing personalized financial advice.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">The Challenges of Manual Portfolio Holdings Analysis</strong></h2><p id="">For most financial advisors, gathering portfolio data starts with client-provided documents—PDFs, scans, and even images of brokerage statements. Manually extracting data like security names, quantities, transaction dates, and prices from these documents can take hours.</p><p id="">Key challenges include:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Time-Consuming</strong>: Sifting through documents to pull relevant portfolio data can take hours per client, delaying analysis and reporting.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Risk of Human Error</strong>: Manually entering data opens the door to errors. A single typo or misreading of a document can lead to inaccurate portfolio insights.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Inconsistent Formats</strong>: Client documents often come in various formats, making it difficult to streamline the extraction process. PDFs, scanned images, and different report layouts increase the complexity.</li></ul><p id="">Ultimately, these challenges reduce productivity and leave less time for high-value activities like client consultations, portfolio optimization, or business development.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/how-to-analyze-client-brokerage-statemen__6706977322c8e9f94621630b_670693e6e9e1f7c497767704_.png" loading="lazy" alt="Sample brokerage statement from Fidelity demonstrating the challenges with manually analyzing portfolio holdings" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h2 id=""><strong id="">How Investipal’s IDP Tool Works</strong></h2><p id="">Investipal’s Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) tool combines two powerful technologies—OCR and AI—to streamline portfolio holdings analysis for financial advisors.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/how-to-analyze-client-brokerage-statemen__66bf5d969464e3a3261b258b_66bf5b10b2e17620bfc313a4_.png" loading="lazy" alt="Visualization of brokerage statement automation workflow" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h2 id=""><strong id="">OCR for Automated Data Extraction</strong></h2><p id="">The <a href="/blog/how-to-leverage-ocr-technology-for-faster-client-account-statement-analysis">OCR feature</a> within Investipal’s IDP tool scans brokerage statements, PDFs, and images of account documents, instantly recognizing key portfolio data. This includes securities names, quantities, prices, and transaction details. Instead of manually inputting data from multiple formats, OCR automates the process by converting this unstructured information into a structured, usable format.</p><p id="">For example, a scanned PDF of a client’s brokerage statement that might have taken hours to process manually can now be analyzed in minutes with OCR. The tool reads the document and extracts key data without any manual entry, eliminating the bottleneck of data extraction.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">AI for Enhanced Data Interpretation</strong></h2><p id="">While OCR helps extract data, AI takes things a step further by interpreting it. AI in Investipal’s IDP tool enhances accuracy by categorizing and understanding the context of the extracted data. It learns from previous inputs, meaning that over time, the tool becomes better at handling complex formats and non-standard data.</p><p id="">This AI-driven process not only ensures greater accuracy in portfolio analysis but also flags potential errors or inconsistencies that might go unnoticed in manual reviews. Whether it’s detecting outliers in transaction data or identifying duplicate records, AI ensures the data you work with is reliable and ready for further analysis.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/how-to-analyze-client-brokerage-statemen__6706977422c8e9f94621632c_6706941824110adb5068f69c_.png" loading="lazy" alt="Uploading a brokerage statement PDF into Investipal for automated analysis" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h2 id=""><strong id="">Key Benefits of Using IDP for Portfolio Holdings Analysis</strong></h2><ol start="" id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Time-Saving and Increased Efficiency</strong><ul id=""><li id="">Investipal’s IDP tool dramatically reduces the time spent on manual data entry.
