<p id=""><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.sec.gov/regulation-best-interest">Regulation Best Interest</a> (<a href="/features/regulation-best-interest-generator">Reg BI</a>) is designed to ensure that financial advisors and broker-dealers act in their client’s best interests when making recommendations. While the regulation is necessary for protecting investors, compliance can be a labor-intensive and time-consuming task for firms. Advisors must provide detailed documentation of every recommendation, including explanations of costs, conflicts of interest, and why the recommendation is suitable for the client.</p><p id="">Investipal’s <strong id="">AI-powered <a href="/features/regulation-best-interest-generator">Reg BI</a> Generator</strong> helps financial professionals meet these requirements by automating much of the compliance process. This solution streamlines the creation of compliant documents, reduces the time spent on administrative tasks, and ensures that advisors meet regulatory standards with accuracy and consistency.</p><h2 id="">The Challenge of Reg BI Compliance</h2><p id=""><a href="/features/regulation-best-interest-generator">Reg BI</a> <a href="/blog/regulation-best-interest-reg-bi-what-financial-advisors-and-broker-dealers-need-to-know" id="">requires financial professionals</a> to meet four main obligations: <strong id="">Disclosure</strong>, <strong id="">Care</strong>, <strong id="">Conflict of Interest</strong>, and <strong id="">Compliance</strong>. This means advisors need to disclose all relevant facts, including fees, risks, and any potential conflicts of interest. Each recommendation must be clearly documented, and advisors must explain why the recommended investment serves the client’s financial goals.</p><p id="">For many firms, this involves manually gathering data, drafting documents, and performing ongoing portfolio monitoring to ensure compliance. These tasks can take a significant amount of time and create a risk of errors, especially when managing a growing client base. Ensuring every recommendation is documented correctly and aligned with Reg BI can quickly become overwhelming.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/how-investipals-ai-simplifies-reg-bi-com__67093faf279077376c900a61_67093d094394794df1b86e8d_.png" loading="lazy" alt="A picture of a document and explanation of the challenges with manually completing Regulation Best Interest compliance documentation " width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h2 id="">How Investipal’s AI Reg BI Generator Helps</h2><p id="">Investipal’s Reg BI Generator uses <strong id="">artificial intelligence</strong> to handle many of these administrative and compliance tasks. Advisors input their rationale for each recommendation, and the AI pulls in data from various sources—such as product details, client risk profiles, and fee structures—to automatically generate fully compliant documents.</p><ol start="" id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Automated Document Creation</strong><ul id=""><li id="">Creating documents such as the <strong id="">Customer Relationship Summary (Form CRS)</strong> or disclosures can be a manual and time-intensive process. Advisors need to explain how their recommendation aligns with the client’s goals and ensure <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.figmarketing.com/blog/finra-reg-bi-checklist-20-compliance-requirements-infographic/" id="">all necessary disclosures</a> on fees and risks are included.</li><li id="">With Investipal, the AI simplifies this process.

For example, if an advisor recommends moving a client into a new fund, the AI will use real-time data on fund performance and fees, while also taking into account the client’s risk tolerance and financial objectives. This ensures that every recommendation is fully documented and <a href="/blog/regulation-best-interest-reg-bi-what-financial-advisors-and-broker-dealers-need-to-know" id="">compliant</a>.</li></ul></li><li id=""><strong id="">Real-Time Compliance Monitoring</strong><ul id=""><li id="">Compliance doesn’t stop after the initial recommendation.
