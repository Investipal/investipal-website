<p id="">As a financial advisor, conducting a comparative analysis of your clients' portfolios against your models is crucial. It helps you identify the right strategy to meet their financial goals and risk tolerance, and effectively communicate this to prospects and clients. But let's be honest—it's time-consuming.</p><p id="">But doing this comparative portfolio analysis manually involves gathering data, running calculations, and building reports - usually in excel or some other point solution. All of this takes away from the time you could spend advising clients or growing your practice.</p><p id="">In this post, we’ll explore how automating comparative portfolio analyses with tools like <strong id="">Investipal</strong> can save you time, increase accuracy, and help you deliver better results for your clients.</p><h2 id="">What is Comparative Portfolio Analysis?</h2><p id="">Comparative portfolio analysis involves comparing a client’s current portfolio against a model portfolio to ensure it aligns with their investment goals. The analysis helps financial advisors uncover discrepancies in <a href="/features/asset-allocation">asset allocation</a> and demonstrate a better way forward to help optimize client portfolios for <strong id="">risk-adjusted returns</strong>.</p><p id="">Traditionally, this is a manual process, requiring data extraction, performance calculations, and report generation. It’s labor-intensive, but essential for guiding clients toward more optimized portfolios.</p><h2 id="">Why is Manual Portfolio Comparison So Time-Consuming?</h2><p id="">Manual portfolio comparison presents several challenges that can eat up your time:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Time-Intensive Data Collection</strong>: Gathering client information from various account statements and brokerage reports is tedious and repetitive.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Complex Calculations</strong>: Calculating risk metrics such as <strong id="">volatility</strong>, <strong id="">beta</strong>, <strong id="">Sharpe ratio, downside capture, and Value-at-Risk</strong> requires manual effort, which increases the risk of human error.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Reporting</strong>: Once calculations are completed, you need to transform the results into client-friendly reports, which is yet another time-consuming task.</li></ul><h2 id="">How Can Automation Simplify Portfolio Comparison for Advisors?</h2><p id="">Automation can eliminate much of the manual effort involved in portfolio comparison.
