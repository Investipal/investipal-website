<p id="">As we reflect on Q3, we’re pleased to share new platform updates that simplify your workflow, deepen client engagement, and make it easier to analyze client portfolios. Here’s a look at what’s new:</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">1. Enhanced AI Statement Scanner</strong></h3><p id="">This quarter, we enhanced our <a href="/blog/tag/ai">AI</a> <a href="/features/automated-statement-scanner">Statement Scanner</a> to handle larger documents with ease. Now, advisors can upload documents up to 100+ pages, expanding the tool’s reach and making it possible to extract data from even the most detailed client records. This means less time on manual data entry and more time for client relationships.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Key Benefits:</strong></p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Expanded Document Coverage:</strong> Upload multi-page statements, even lengthy brokerage reports, and extract information in minutes.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Automated Data Extraction:</strong> Pull account holdings and other data directly from PDFs and large documents.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Efficient Analysis:</strong> Use AI to extract, review, and interpret data, allowing faster insights.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Fewer Errors:</strong> Reduce mistakes that come with manual entry, especially for long documents.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Time Saved:</strong> Reclaim valuable time from data entry for client work.</li></ul><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/q3-product-updates-ai-document-scanning-__672143258eae8d248e429fd7_6721420f4085bfe4062f8561_.png" loading="lazy" alt="Extract holdings from brokerage statement PDFs" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id=""><strong id="">2. Explainable AI Portfolio Builder</strong></h3><p id="">We’ve developed a proprietary portfolio builder doesn’t just automate asset allocation recommendations—it explains them. This tool takes personalization to a new level by constructing portfolios based on an advisor’s asset universe and aligns them with each client’s risk profile, interests and tax considerations. Unlike traditional “black box” models, it provides clear reasoning behind each recommendation, so advisors can confidently share their decision-making process with clients and relevant stakeholders.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Key Features:</strong></p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Transparent Decisions:</strong> Know the reasoning behind each allocation to build client trust.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Personalized Portfolios:</strong> Align every portfolio with the client’s specific goals and risk level.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Compliance-Friendly:</strong> Meet regulatory demands with clear, traceable decision-making.</li></ul><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/q3-product-updates-ai-document-scanning-__672143248eae8d248e429fc6_67214237c2f24b89182db334_.png" loading="lazy" alt="Personalized portfolio construction using AI" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id=""><strong id="">3. AI-Generated Reg BI Documentation</strong></h3><p id="">Meeting regulatory requirements and communicating recommendations effectively are critical components of advisory practice. Our new AI-Generated Best Interest Statements help advisors automatically generate compliant, client-specific documentation that clearly explains why a recommendation aligns with each client’s best interests.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Key Benefits:</strong></p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Automated Compliance Support:</strong> The AI system automatically produces statements that meet regulatory standards, allowing you to focus on advising rather than documentation.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Personalized Explanations:</strong> Each statement is customized to the client’s individual needs, investment profile, and goals, ensuring clarity and transparency in recommendations.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Time and Error Reduction:</strong> Avoid hours spent drafting statements manually while minimizing the risk of documentation errors, giving you more time for client conversations.</li></ul><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/q3-product-updates-ai-document-scanning-__672143258eae8d248e429fdd_6721424d6c2ca88b04b56a43_.png" loading="lazy" alt="Generating Regulation Best Interest documents with AI" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id=""><strong id="">Additional Enhancements</strong></h3><p id="">In addition to our major releases, we’ve rolled out several smaller updates to improve functionality across the platform:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Enhanced Portfolio Visualizations:</strong> Updated visuals improve clarity, making it easier to communicate insights to clients.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Sales Proposal Enhancements:</strong> Streamlined templates and customization options help you create impactful proposals more efficiently.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Multi-Lingual Support:</strong> With expanded support for French and Portuguese, advisors can now better serve diverse client bases.</li></ul><h3 id=""><strong id="">Looking Ahead</strong></h3><p id="">These updates are part of our ongoing commitment to helping advisors thrive in an ever-evolving landscape.
