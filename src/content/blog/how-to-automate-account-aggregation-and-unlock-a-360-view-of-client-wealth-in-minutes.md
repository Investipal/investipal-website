<p>Fragmented client data stands between most advisory firms and their growth goals. Too many teams still spend hours sorting through PDF statements, collecting held-away account balances by email, and rekeying spreadsheets—wasting valuable time and introducing risk at every step. It doesn’t have to be this way. With modern automation, you can unlock a true 360° view of client wealth in minutes, not weeks. Here’s how leading <a href="/segments/wealth-managers">wealth managers</a> are making it happen—and how you can, too, with Investipal.</p>

<h2>The Operational Cost of Manual Account Aggregation</h2>
<p>Most advisory teams know the pain:</p>
<ul><li>Endless back-and-forth to collect statements from every custodian, 401(k) provider, or old brokerage relationship—often in inconsistent formats.</li><li>Manually transcribing positions, values, and tax lots from PDFs or even scanned images and handwritten notes.</li><li>Juggling multiple tools to cobble together a complete household view—risking omissions and errors that erode trust and compliance.</li><li>Hours spent reentering data for proposal analysis, <a href="/features/investment-policy-statements">IPS</a> generation, and regulatory forms—slowing onboarding, proposals, and growth.</li></ul>
<p>This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a drag on firm profitability and advisor productivity. For a typical book, inefficiencies in aggregation alone can add up to hundreds of wasted hours annually.</p>

<h2>Modern Account Aggregation: What It Really Means</h2>
<p>Automated account aggregation takes fragmented data from everywhere your clients hold assets—brokerage, retirement, banking, and even alternatives—and unifies it into a complete, real-time portfolio. But it’s not just about collecting balances. True, holistic aggregation means:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Multi-format data extraction:</strong> Instantly ingest portfolios from PDFs, images, spreadsheets, and more—no manual entry required.</li><li><strong>Held-away asset sync:</strong> Aggregate IRAs, 401(k)s, and accounts across multiple custodians, even if they aren’t directly integrated with your tech stack.</li><li><strong>Standardized, structured portfolios:</strong> All holdings, classifications, performance, and risk details are parsed, categorized, and ready for analysis automatically.</li></ul>
<p>This eliminates the biggest bottlenecks in onboarding, proposal generation, and compliance documentation—for every household, no matter how complex.</p>

<h2>Why a 360° View of Client Wealth Matters More Than Ever</h2>
<p>Clients expect their advisor to have a full, up-to-date picture of their wealth—across all accounts. Partial data leads to:</p>
<ul><li>Missed opportunities for tax optimization, risk reduction, or cross-selling (like insurance or alternatives)</li><li>Blind spots in proposals and recommendations, reducing close rates and AUM growth</li><li>Compliance gaps or NIGOs (Not in Good Order items) caused by missing account info</li><li>Time-consuming, error-prone prep work before every client meeting</li></ul>
<p>Holistic aggregation isn’t just a nice-to-have. It’s the foundation of delivering value, building trust, and scaling your practice efficiently.</p>

<h2>How Investipal Automates Account Aggregation from Start to Finish</h2>

<ul><li>Does the tool ingest data from all file types—PDFs, images, statements, and spreadsheets—not just direct API feeds?</li><li>Can you aggregate held-away and non-custodial assets with the same level of detail and accuracy as core holdings?</li><li>Are compliance and proposal workflows fully integrated, or will you need more tools and manual steps?</li><li>How quickly can the data be visualized, analyzed, and put to work for onboarding, proposals, or compliance?</li><li>What security and privacy standards does the platform uphold?</li></ul>
