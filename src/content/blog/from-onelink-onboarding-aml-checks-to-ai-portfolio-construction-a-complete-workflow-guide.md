<p id="">Manual <a href="/blog/category/onboarding">onboarding</a>, error-prone compliance, and disconnected portfolio tools are some of the biggest roadblocks for modern advisory practices - and the pressure to grow AUM without increasing overhead is higher than ever. At Investipal, we’ve worked shoulder-to-shoulder with RIAs, independent advisors, and wealth management firms, so we understand these aren’t just workflow snags - they’re critical bottlenecks. This guide unpacks what a truly integrated workflow should look like: from seamless, one-link <a href="/blog/category/onboarding">onboarding</a> and automated AML checks, all the way to AI-driven portfolio construction and compliance, built for scale and speed. </p><h2 id="">Where the Modern Advisor Workflow Breaks Down</h2><ul id=""><li id=""><a href="/blog/category/onboarding">Onboarding</a> requires chasing paperwork, manually keying in statement data, and sending multiple links to clients with varied documents - costing hours and risking errors.</li><li id="">Compliance checks slow things down and are often siloed in different processes and tools.</li><li id="">Building personalized, optimized portfolios (let alone including alternatives) is complex, siloed, and almost impossible to scale.</li></ul><p id="">If any of this sounds familiar, it’s likely your tech stack is stitched together from multiple point solutions.
