Let's dive in!</p><p id="">Well, imagine you're at said buffet and instead of choosing individual dishes, you're served a bit of everything on offer. That's exactly how total stock market funds operate. Instead of hand-picking stocks, these funds invest in a broad swath of the market, representing nearly every publicly traded company.</p><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Investing in a Broad Market:</strong> The fund manager purchases stocks that represent the entire U.S. stock market.
