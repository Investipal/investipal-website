<p id="">Risk tolerance questionnaires are widely recognized as essential tools. These questionnaires assess a client's willingness to take risks and their ability to handle potential losses and market volatility. And they are used primarily to inform <a href="/blog/category/portfolio-management">portfolio construction</a>, to ensure alignment with the client’s risk profile and stated goals.</p><p id="">But, the effectiveness of this process depends on the questionnaire's validity and reliability. Building a portfolio from an inaccurate assessment may lead to poor outcomes and dissatisfied clients. Unfortunately, many of today's assessments prove ineffective. In this article, we’ll explore the current state of risk tolerance questionnaires, methods for improvement, and the benefits of using a software-based questionnaire.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">The Current State of Risk Tolerance Questionnaires</strong></h2><h3 id=""><strong id="">The limitations of existing questionnaires</strong></h3><p id="">Current risk tolerance questionnaires often <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/risk-tolerance-questionnaire-and-risk-profiling-problems-for-financial-advisors-planplus-study/" id="">fail</a> to accurately predict real-life investor behavior. This is usually due to several issues:</p><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Inaccuracy in predicting real-life investor behavior:</strong> Most questionnaires rely too heavily on hypothetical scenarios. How someone <em id="">says</em> they will react is usually quite different than how they <em id="">will</em> react. This discrepancy can produce inaccurate assessment results. This is not to say that hypothetical scenarios aren’t useful; but that they should be factored in carefully.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Influence of arbitrary reference points on responses:</strong> The framing of questions can impact an investor’s response. For instance, questions about losses framed in terms of dollars or percentages may influence someone’s opinion. Recency bias is another example that can change responses, i.e. an investor’s current situation or recent market events. These factors can lead to inconsistent and potentially misleading results.</li></ol><h3 id=""><strong id="">The necessity for improved questionnaire design</strong></h3><p id="">These limitations underscore the need for better risk tolerance questionnaire design. Developing more accurate and reliable questionnaires can help financial advisors better understand their clients’ true risk tolerance, leading to better portfolio design and, hopefully, improved client satisfaction.</p><p id="">So, how can risk tolerance questionnaires be improved to get more accurate and consistent results? The current leading approach focuses on incorporating the concept of psychometric validity.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Understanding Psychometric Validity</strong></h2><p id="">Psychometric validity is a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0023/1330655/FPRJ-Vol6-Iss1-2020-Paper2-Grable-et-al.pdf" id="">crucial concept</a> for risk tolerance questionnaires. It refers to how accurately a questionnaire measures the construct it is intended to assess. In this case, that construct is <em id="">risk tolerance</em>.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Definition and importance in questionnaire design</strong></h3><p id="">There are three main components of psychometric validity: content validity, construct validity, and criterion validity.</p><ul id=""><li id=""><em id="">Content validity</em> assesses whether the questions in a questionnaire adequately cover the entire domain of the construct being measured.<ul id=""><li id="">Example: questions measuring different aspects of risk tolerance, such as willingness to take risks, ability to handle financial losses, and comfort with market volatility. It could also mean taking different asset classes into account like stocks, bonds, and real estate.</li></ul></li><li id=""><em id="">Construct validity</em> evaluates how well the questionnaire differentiates between related and unrelated constructs.<ul id=""><li id="">Example: asking questions that help to distinguish between risk tolerance and related constructs like investment knowledge, financial literacy, or even the difference between willingness to take risks and ability to handle losses.</li></ul></li><li id=""><em id="">Criterion validity</em> is the relationship between the questionnaire scores (i.e. the results) and relevant external criteria.<ul id=""><li id="">Example: the predictive ability of real-life investor behavior like reaction(s) to market volatility or satisfaction with investment returns.</li></ul></li></ul><p id="">Taking this approach helps to ensure that the questions asked are relevant, reliable, and accurate. High psychometric validity is ideal and this enables financial advisors to make well-informed investment recommendations, grounded in their clients’ true risk profile.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/inline/improving-risk-tolerance-questionnaires-for-better-financial-planning-0-19b7167976.webp" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id=""><strong id="">How psychometric validity can improve risk tolerance questionnaires: An example</strong></h3><p id="">Perhaps the best example of a risk tolerance questionnaire with high psychometric validity is the Risk Tolerance Scale (RTS) <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://static.arnaudsylvain.fr/2017/03/Grable-Lyton-1999-Financial-Risk-revisited.pdf" id="">developed by Grable and Lytton</a> in 1999. The RTS consists of 13 items that assess various aspects of risk tolerance, such as risk aversion, risk perception, and risk-taking behavior.</p><p id="">Here are three sample questions from the RTS:</p><ol id=""><li id="">I am willing to take a substantial financial risk to earn a substantial return.<ul id=""><li id="">Strongly Disagree</li><li id="">Disagree</li><li id="">Neither Agree nor Disagree</li><li id="">Agree</li><li id="">Strongly Agree</li></ul></li><li id="">I would feel comfortable investing in a financial asset if I knew there was a chance I could lose some of my investment.<ul id=""><li id="">Strongly Disagree</li><li id="">Disagree</li><li id="">Neither Agree nor Disagree</li><li id="">Agree</li><li id="">Strongly Agree</li></ul></li><li id="">I am willing to take above-average financial risks to achieve above-average returns.<ul id=""><li id="">Strongly Disagree</li><li id="">Disagree</li><li id="">Neither Agree nor Disagree</li><li id="">Agree</li><li id="">Strongly Agree</li></ul></li></ol><p id="">Taken as a whole, they found that the questionnaire demonstrated the ability to differentiate between the concepts and accurately measure risk tolerance. This was a major step forward in 1999 and helped lead to the creation of better assessments that produced more accurate, consistent, and reliable results.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">Developing Better Risk Tolerance Questionnaires</strong></h2><p id="">So, to summarize, creating better risk tolerance questionnaires requires :</p><ol id=""><li id="">Incorporating real-life scenario/past investor behavior rather than relying heavily and/or solely on hypothetical scenarios,</li><li id="">Avoiding psychological bias in responses,</li><li id="">And ensuring that the questions contain a high degree of psychometric validity</li></ol><h3 id=""><strong id="">Incorporating real-life scenarios and past investor behavior</strong></h3><p id="">Traditional risk tolerance questionnaires often rely just on hypothetical scenarios. As we now know, this approach probably doesn’t capture an investor's true risk tolerance. To mitigate these issues and improve questionnaires, assessments should take into account an investor’s actual investment experiences, past decisions, and, perhaps most importantly, <a href="/portfolio-risk-assessment" id=""><em id="">their existing portfolio</em></a>. In doing so, you can get objective data and then compare it with the subjective responses. This allows you to identify any discrepancies between the client’s stated risk tolerance and their actual investment behavior and leads to better empirical grounding to construct a portfolio from. Done within a software-based risk questionnaire, this analysis can be completed instantly (and can actually automate common next steps like IPS and proposal generation. More on that below).</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/inline/improving-risk-tolerance-questionnaires-for-better-financial-planning-1-03baa654a7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id=""><strong id="">Measuring abstract psychological traits related to risk tolerance</strong></h3><p id="">As mentioned earlier, an investor’s perception of risk tolerance can be influenced by various psychological biases, like recency bias. To avoid this, a good risk tolerance questionnaire should measure abstract psychological traits, such as risk aversion, loss aversion, and time preference. This can be done by including questions that assess an investor's attitudes and emotions related to risk, potential losses, and long-term investment horizons.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">Ensuring reliability and validity in questionnaire results</strong></h3><p id="">Or, in other words, psychometric validity.</p><p id="">As we have seen, a risk tolerance questionnaire with high psychometric validity will produce accurate and reliable results by incorporating the three core concepts of (1) content validity, (2) construct validity and (3) criterion validity.</p><p id="">By focusing on these key aspects and taking an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/07/07/kitces-the-big-problem-with-risk-tolerance/" id="">integrated approach</a>, financial advisors can create more accurate, reliable, and comprehensive risk tolerance questionnaires. Or, you can take it a step further and leverage a good software-based risk tolerance questionnaire that comes with several other benefits.</p><h2 id=""><strong id="">The Advantages of Software-Based Risk Questionnaires</strong></h2><p id="">One significant advantage of using a well-designed software-based risk questionnaire, as opposed to a manually constructed one, is the ability to leverage technology to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and user experience. Here are some key benefits:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Automated scoring and analysis: Software-based questionnaires can automatically calculate scores and analyze responses, eliminating the potential for human error in manual scoring and streamlining the process of interpreting results.</li><li id="">Real-time updates and customization: Software-based questionnaires can be easily updated and customized to reflect changes in market conditions, regulatory requirements, or client preferences. This ensures that the questionnaire remains relevant and effective over time.</li><li id="">Enhanced user experience: A well-designed software interface can make the process of completing a risk questionnaire more engaging and intuitive for clients, encouraging more thoughtful responses and reducing the likelihood of incomplete or inaccurate information.</li></ul><h3 id="">Integration with other financial planning tools</h3><p id="">Another key benefit of software-based risk tolerance questionnaires is the integration with other financial planning tools and platforms, streamlining the overall planning process.. One such integration is the generation of investment policy statements (IPS) and proposals based on the risk tolerance assessment results.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Connecting the risk questionnaire with IPS and proposal generation</strong></p><p id="">By connecting risk questionnaire results with IPS and proposal generation tools, financial advisors can automatically create customized documents tailored to each client's risk profile, investment objectives, and constraints. This not only saves time but also ensures consistency and accuracy in the document creation process. With this streamlined process, advisors can move from risk assessment to presenting clients with a comprehensive investment plan, reducing the time it takes to convert prospects into clients, improving overall efficiency, and shortening the revenue recognition cycle.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/inline/improving-risk-tolerance-questionnaires-for-better-financial-planning-2-1466901eea.webp" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h2 id=""><strong id="">A Word of Caution</strong></h2><p id="">While it’s important to acknowledge that risk tolerance questionnaires will never be perfect, incorporating the principles discussed above can significantly improve their accuracy and reliability. The complex nature of human behavior and the inherent challenges in measuring abstract psychological constructs mean that there will always be some degree of uncertainty and error in questionnaire results. However, focusing on incorporating real-life scenarios and/or past behavior, measuring relevant psychological traits, and a high degree of psychological validity can lead to better investment recommendations and more successful outcomes for clients.</p><h2 id="">Get a better risk tolerance questionnaire and automate your workflows</h2><p id="">An advanced risk tolerance questionnaire like Investipal’s Risk Tolerance Questionnaire can give you better data, boost engagement on your website, and save you time.</p><p id="">It incorporates existing holdings to provide objective data that can then be compared to subjective questionnaire responses, so that you can get closer to the truth and construct a portfolio from firmer ground.
