<p id=""><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2025/02/20/morningstar-to-shut-down-its-office-platform-for-advisors/" id="">Morningstar Office will officially sunset in early 2026</a>. Many advisors are scrambling to replace a system they’ve relied on for reporting, billing, and portfolio management. Delaying your move can lead to rushed, error-prone data migrations and forced long-term contracts with subpar platforms.</p><p id="">However, this isn’t just a scramble—it’s <strong id="">an opportunity</strong>. You can <strong id="">consolidate tools and reduce overall costs</strong> during this transition. By taking stock of <strong id="">all</strong> the software your firm uses—from proposal creation and brokerage statement intake to performance reporting—you can modernize your tech stack and build a stronger foundation for future growth.</p><p id="">Below is a <strong id="">90-day plan</strong> to protect your data, serve your clients seamlessly, and streamline your technology so you’re better positioned for the long haul.</p><h2 id="">Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Assess &amp; Shortlist Alternatives</h2><h3 id="">Step 1: Inventory Your Entire Tech Stack</h3><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Catalog Morningstar Office features</strong>: Portfolio tracking, reporting, billing, and investment research.</li><li id=""><strong id="">List out your other tools</strong>: What do you use for client proposals, statement scanning, or manual data entry?</li><li id=""><strong id="">Identify gaps and inefficiencies</strong>: Where are you duplicating effort? Which tasks are completely manual?</li><li id=""><strong id="">Outline future goals</strong>: Is AI-driven portfolio optimization or automated proposal generation on your radar?</li></ol><p id="">Look for an all-in-one solution that can handle multiple needs—like performance reporting, proposal creation, and statement scanning—to trim costs and reduce complexity.</p><h3 id="">Step 2: Compare Morningstar Office Alternatives</h3><p id="">Morningstar is pushing Black Diamond, but a five-year contract and unclear pricing may not be ideal. Other common names include Orion, AdvisorEngine, Advyzon, Tamarac, SEI, Investipal, Capitect, and various newer AI-driven platforms.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Focus on:</strong></p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Pricing &amp; Contracts:</strong> Do you prefer a flat fee or bps structure? Does the vendor lock you into multi-year terms?</li><li id=""><strong id="">Ease of Data Migration:</strong> Can you move your historical performance data without losing important metrics?</li><li id=""><strong id="">Reporting &amp; Performance Tracking:</strong> Are their client-facing reports better, worse, or about the same?</li><li id=""><strong id="">Investment Research:</strong> Will you lose Morningstar-level analytics or need an extra subscription?</li><li id=""><strong id="">Additional Tools &amp; Integrations:</strong> Can they replace your existing proposal generator or data-entry software?</li><li id=""><strong id="">CRM &amp; Custodian Feeds:</strong> Ensure your next platform integrates with core systems like Redtail, Wealthbox, Schwab, or Fidelity.</li></ul><h3 id="">Step 3: Book Demos &amp; Get Pricing Quotes</h3><p id="">Once you’ve narrowed the field to two or three viable options:</p><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Ask for a detailed pricing breakdown</strong> (onboarding costs, monthly fees, extra modules).</li><li id=""><strong id="">Inquire about data migration</strong> (timelines, support, potential downtime).</li><li id=""><strong id="">Verify feature bundling</strong>: Will you pay extra for advanced research or proposal tools?</li><li id=""><strong id="">Check contract flexibility</strong>: Avoid signing on to something you can’t exit if it doesn’t meet expectations.</li></ol><p id="">If you find a platform that can handle proposals, AI rebalancing, and statement scanning, you might eliminate multiple monthly fees you currently pay to different vendors.</p><h2 id="">Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Migrate &amp; Implement the New System</h2><h3 id="">Step 4: Plan Your Data Migration Strategy</h3><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Identify key datasets</strong>: Client portfolios, performance history, billing records, and any research you want to keep.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Coordinate with the new vendor</strong> to map out how each data point from Morningstar Office (and any other tools you’re consolidating) will transfer.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Schedule the migration</strong> at a time that won’t disrupt quarter-end reporting or billing cycles.</li></ol><h3 id="">Step 5: Set Up &amp; Test the New Platform</h3><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Use a sandbox environment</strong> to verify that performance reports, proposals, and data entry features all function as expected.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Compare outputs</strong> from sample client data to ensure accuracy against Morningstar Office or your old software.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Check integrations</strong> with your CRM and custodians for real-time data syncing.</li></ol><h3 id="">Step 6: Train Your Team</h3><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Host workshops</strong> or training sessions so advisors, support staff, and operations can get hands-on experience.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Showcase potential efficiencies</strong>: Automated proposal generation, data entry, or real-time rebalancing can transform how your team works.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Designate a point person</strong> to liaise with the new vendor for any troubleshooting or questions.</li></ol><h2 id="">Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Finalize, Optimize &amp; Communicate</h2><h3 id="">Step 7: Finalize Reports &amp; Client Communications</h3><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Polish up client reports</strong> to match your brand standards.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Send a simple announcement</strong>: Explain what’s changing, why it’s beneficial, and how clients can access new portal features if available.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Prepare instructions or FAQs</strong> if your clients need to log into a new portal or review new-style reports.</li></ol><h3 id="">Step 8: Optimize Workflows &amp; Automate Where Possible</h3><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Automated reporting</strong>: Configure monthly or quarterly statements so they’re generated and delivered without manual intervention.</li><li id=""><strong id="">AI-driven rebalancing</strong>: If your platform supports real-time optimization, set up rules to keep portfolios aligned with targets.</li><li id=""><strong id="">CRM &amp; Email workflows</strong>: Integrate your new system to drive consistent communication and quick follow-ups.</li></ol><h3 id="">Step 9: Review &amp; Adjust for Long-Term Success</h3><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Check for missing data</strong> or any leftover tasks that still require separate software.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Gather feedback</strong> from staff: Are there any cumbersome processes that can be improved through better platform use?</li><li id=""><strong id="">Identify more consolidation opportunities</strong>: Now that you’ve stabilized your core operations, you may see additional ways to simplify or expand your services.</li></ol><h2 id="">This Is Your Chance to Streamline and Grow</h2><p id="">Yes, losing Morningstar Office is a hassle—but it can also be your firm’s chance to <strong id="">cut costs, reduce redundancy, and optimize workflows</strong>. By following this 90-day plan, you’ll not only preserve your data and client relationships, you’ll also position your RIA for smarter, faster growth.</p><p id="">Remember:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Don’t wait</strong>: Start reviewing platforms and locking in demos.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Look for consolidation</strong>: One robust platform might replace two or three separate tools.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Prioritize efficiency</strong>: AI, automated reporting, and integrated proposal generation can free up valuable time.</li></ul><h3 id="">Why Consider Investipal?</h3><p id="">If you’re looking for an all-in-one platform that can replace multiple tools at once, <strong id="">Investipal</strong> is worth a closer look.
