# How to Create an Investment Policy Statement: Complete Guide for RIAs

Advisors don't lose time writing—they lose it rewriting. IPS language drifts across clients, review cycles drag, and audits surface inconsistencies you didn't know existed. This guide provides a proven, repeatable process to create compliant IPS documents without creating compliance debt.

## TL;DR
- Follow a 4-step checklist to create IPS documents (objectives → risk → bands → review cadence)
- Avoid common pitfalls (boilerplate conflicts, missing rebalancing rules)
- Connect IPS to Reg BI and onboarding so docs stay consistent across the workflow
- Use automation to generate personalized IPS in minutes, not hours

## What You'll Learn
You'll learn a practical framework for creating investment policy statements that meet compliance requirements while remaining client-specific. This includes a step-by-step customization process, concrete examples, and strategies to keep IPS language aligned with Reg BI and Form CRS documents.

## What Is an IPS (and Why It Matters)
An investment policy statement (IPS) documents client objectives, constraints, and the process for constructing and maintaining a portfolio. Done well, it anchors advice to stated goals, clarifies roles and responsibilities, and codifies rebalancing and review cadence. That clarity improves client trust and shortens review cycles because the "why" behind the portfolio is always visible.

See related background on obligations at [/learn/reg-bi](/learn/reg-bi) and how teams standardize IPS drafting in [/features/investment-policy-statements](/features/investment-policy-statements).

## Core Sections Every IPS Needs
A complete IPS should include these essential components:
- **Client objectives and constraints** — Time horizon, liquidity needs, tax sensitivities
- **Risk tolerance and capacity** — Documented through questionnaires and portfolio analysis
- **Asset allocation policy** — Target weights with ranges (bands)
- **Rebalancing guidelines** — Frequency, triggers, and exception handling
- **Monitoring and reporting** — Review cadence and performance evaluation criteria

These sections form the foundation of a compliant, client-specific IPS that can be efficiently maintained and updated.

## How to Customize (4-Step Checklist)
Start by clarifying objectives and constraints: time horizon, liquidity, tax sensitivities, and any special considerations. Then translate risk tolerance and risk capacity into allocation bands and guardrails that reflect how the portfolio should behave. Next, define rebalancing rules in plain language—how often you check, what bands trigger an action, and how exceptions are documented. Finally, set the monitoring cadence and reporting format so clients know what to expect and reviewers know what to look for.

### Step 1: Clarify objectives and constraints
Write the client’s goals and practical limits in one concise paragraph. Avoid vague phrases; be specific about timelines and liquidity needs.

### Step 2: Map risk to allocation bands
Convert risk tolerance and ability into target weights with ranges. Bands make reviews faster because drift and rationale are explicit.

### Step 3: Define rebalancing rules
Describe frequency, triggers, and exception handling. A simple rule—quarterly check, ±5% bands, document exceptions—reduces ambiguity.

### Step 4: Set monitoring and reporting
State how performance is evaluated (e.g., net of fees vs a blended benchmark) and when reviews occur. Spell out what prompts an interim review.

## Common Pitfalls (and Fixes)
Boilerplate that doesn’t match real practice causes friction in reviews. Align the language to your actual rebalancing cadence and monitoring process. Missing rebalancing rules lead to inconsistent actions; add bands and a default response when thresholds are breached. Overly rigid constraints limit judgment; use ranges with a clear exception process so discretion is documented, not improvised.

## Where This Fits in Your Workflow
The IPS should connect intake to recommendations and ongoing supervision—not live in a silo. Data from statements and risk questionnaires informs the allocation policy; proposal generation explains the “why” using that policy; compliance documents (IPS and Reg BI) are produced together so language stays aligned; and account opening inherits the same assumptions.

If you ingest statements, see [/features/statement-scanner](/features/statement-scanner). For optimization and comparison during proposals, see [/learn/portfolio-optimization](/learn/portfolio-optimization). To keep Reg BI documentation aligned with IPS, use [/features/regulation-best-interest-generator](/features/regulation-best-interest-generator). For paperwork and e‑sign, reference [/solutions/onboarding-account-opening](/solutions/onboarding-account-opening).

## Example Clauses to Tailor
Objectives: “The portfolio aims to preserve purchasing power and target real growth over a rolling five‑year horizon.” Rebalancing: “Quarterly review; rebalance when bands exceed ±5% of target weights; exceptions documented with rationale.” Monitoring: “Performance is evaluated net of fees against a blended policy benchmark; variances greater than 3% over a rolling year trigger a written review.” Use these as patterns—keep the structure consistent, the values client‑specific.

## FAQ
### What’s the difference between a template and an example?
A template is a structured starting point; an example shows a filled version for a scenario.

### Can I use the same IPS for all clients?
No. Customize objectives, constraints, and allocation bands per client; keep structure consistent, content tailored.

### Do I need a Reg BI document too?
Yes—Reg BI governs care, disclosure, conflicts, and compliance obligations; pair IPS with Form CRS and Reg BI documentation.
