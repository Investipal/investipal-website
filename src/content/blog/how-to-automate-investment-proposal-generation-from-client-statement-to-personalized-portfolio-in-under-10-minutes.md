<p>Manually creating investment proposals slows down even the best advisory teams. Hours are lost parsing client brokerage statements, wrangling spreadsheets, and re-entering data into compliance templates—leaving little time for what matters most: winning business and delivering value to clients. If you’re a financial advisor, wealth manager, or RIA firm owner, you’re likely feeling these pains. The good news? With automation, that entire process—from receiving a client’s statement to sending a personalized, compliance-ready proposal—can now take less than 10 minutes. Here’s how.</p>

<h2>The High Cost of Manual Proposal Workflows</h2>
<p>Let’s be direct. The old way isn’t just inefficient—it’s risky and costly:</p>
<ul><li>Brokerage statement data entry eats up 3–5 hours per prospective client, per account.</li><li>Juggling spreadsheets, PDFs, CRM tools, and proposal docs leads to mistakes, duplicate data, and security risks.</li><li>Compliance steps (IPS, Reg BI, KYP documentation) are tedious, error-prone, and easy to miss in siloed systems.</li><li>Personalizing each proposal becomes a challenge, especially when you’re scaling across hundreds of clients.</li></ul>
<p>The result? Opportunities lost, prospects dropping off during slow onboarding, and regulatory headaches if anything slips.</p>

<h2>What Does True Proposal Automation Look Like?</h2>
<p>Automation must do more than replace manual data entry. It needs to connect onboarding, analysis, proposal generation, and compliance end-to-end. Here’s how Investipal enables you to deliver a personal, polished proposal in under 10 minutes—with no trade-off in data quality or compliance.</p>

<ul><li>Drag and drop a brokerage statement—PDF, image, even a scan with handwritten notes—into Investipal.</li><li>Our <strong>AI-powered statement scanner</strong> instantly reads and structures every holding, cost basis, tax lot, and account-level detail.</li><li>Held-away assets? Sync IRAs, 401(k)s, and other accounts for a full household view—no need to chase down missing files or spend hours on data wrangling.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Key benefit:</strong> You save 3–5 hours per statement, and manual entry errors are eliminated. The data is ready seconds after upload.</p>

<h3>2. Instantly Visualize and Analyze the Prospect’s Portfolio</h3>
<ul><li>All holdings, allocations, exposures, and risk factors flow from the statement into Investipal’s <a href="/book-a-demo" target=_blank>portfolio analytics engine</a>.</li><li>Run a complete X-Ray: concentration risks, sector/geography breakdowns, correlations, cost structures, tax exposure, and over 20 other risk indicators—no spreadsheet work needed.</li><li>Compare the current portfolio with your recommended model or investment universe, including both public and alternative assets.</li><li>Backtest, stress-test, and identify actionable improvements—like lower fees or reduced volatility—at a glance.</li></ul>
