<p id="">Processing client account statements can be a slow, tedious process for financial advisors. Manually scanning the document, entering data, double-checking everything, and ensuring accuracy takes valuable time that could be spent on more important tasks. But there’s a way to speed things up and make your life easier: <a href="/features/automated-statement-scanner">OCR</a> (Optical Character Recognition) technology.</p><p id=""><a href="/features/automated-statement-scanner">OCR</a> automates data extraction from documents, saving you hours of work and reducing the chances of mistakes. In this post, we’ll break down how <a href="/features/automated-statement-scanner">OCR</a> works, why it matters for financial advisors, and how you can use it to set up client accounts more efficiently.</p><h2 id="">What is OCR Technology?</h2><p id=""><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/guides/what-is-ocr.html" id="">OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition</a>. Simply put, it’s technology that reads text from scanned documents, PDFs, or images and turns it into editable, searchable data. Think of it as a way to skip the manual typing and get straight to the part where everything is digital and ready to go.</p><p id="">For financial advisors, OCR can be a game-changer. Instead of spending hours on data entry for client account statements, you can process everything in minutes. Investipal’s OCR scanner, for instance, is 95% accurate, meaning you can rely on it to handle your data with precision and speed.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth"><div id=""><img src="/images/inline/how-to-leverage-ocr-technology-for-faster-client-account-statement-analysis-0-c008b8c549.webp" loading="lazy" alt="An illustration of automating data extraction from brokerage statements" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h2 id="">The Problem with Manual Client Account Statement Analysis</h2><p id="">If you’ve ever processed a client account statement manually, you know how frustrating it can be.
