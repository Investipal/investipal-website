<p id="">Financial advisors wear many hats, including the critically important but often laborious job of gathering data and doing analysis. This process can feel like a constant battle against time and errors. Sifting through countless statements and documents is a slow, tedious process.</p><p id="">The good news is artificial intelligence (<a href="/blog/tag/ai">AI</a>) is fundamentally changing this process (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.sphereinc.com/blogs/optimizing-wealth-management/" id="">and many others</a>), automating these tasks and empowering advisors to focus on what matters most: their clients.</p><p id="">This article explores how AI is transforming how advisors gather and analyze data, leading to a new era of efficient and precise portfolio management.</p><h3 id="">1. Data Challenges of Holistic Portfolio Analysis with New and Existing Clients</h3><p id="">Financial advisors face several roadblocks when it comes to comprehensive portfolio analysis:</p><h3 id="">Fragmented Data Across Multiple Accounts</h3><p id="">Imagine trying to piece together a complex puzzle with parts scattered across different places. This is the challenge when collecting data from various financial accounts and institutions. The manual process of gathering and verifying account statements can slow down workflow and increase the chances of errors. Key details needed include:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Share/security/ticker names</li><li id="">Quantities</li><li id="">Purchase prices</li><li id="">Current values</li><li id="">Transaction dates</li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div><img src="/images/blog/how-artificial-intelligence-speeds-data-__66e2025816f03697097a205c_669abdf1884cb9fcf66ddfea_.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><h3 id="">Uncovering Hidden Assets in Held-Away Accounts</h3><p id="">Another significant challenge is identifying assets that aren’t directly managed. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2023/03/08/why-advisors-shouldnt-ignore-clients-held-away-cash/" id="">These hidden assets are critical</a> for a comprehensive financial view but are often missed due to manual data collection. Without these pieces, portfolio assessments may be incomplete or inaccurate.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div><img src="/images/blog/how-artificial-intelligence-speeds-data-__66e2025816f03697097a2062_669abdfabe66fff23b127002_.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><h3 id="">Aggregating Holdings for Comprehensive Analysis</h3><p id="">Once data is collected, it needs to be compiled into a single, unified format for effective analysis. This step is not only time-consuming but also susceptible to errors. Common mistakes include:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Incorrect ticker symbols (a single letter can change the entire security)</li><li id="">Wrong quantities</li><li id="">Misformatted dates and currency values</li></ul><h3 id="">Additional Considerations</h3><p id="">Inconsistent data and errors can have a significant impact on portfolio management. Timely data updates are essential for effective monitoring and management, but manual updates often lag, leading to outdated information and suboptimal decisions.</p><h3 id="">2. AI-Powered Data Gathering Solutions</h3><p id="">AI technology addresses these challenges by automating many aspects of data gathering:</p><h3 id="">OCR Technology Enhanced by AI for Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)</h3><p id="">Think of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ocr/" id="">Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</a> technology as a super-efficient assistant, especially when integrated with AI to create <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.abbyy.com/blog/ocr-vs-idp/" id="">Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)</a>. This combination <a href="/blog/using-ocr-technology-to-automate-account-statement-scanning-for-financial-advisors">automates the extraction</a> of data from account statements and documents, speeding up the data entry process and reducing errors. AI improves OCR by enabling it to handle more complex documents and learn from corrections, ensuring continuous improvement. OCR technology precisely captures crucial details, including:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Share/security/ticker names</li><li id="">Quantities</li><li id="">Transaction dates</li></ul><p id="">IDP leverages AI to classify documents, extract relevant information, and understand context, transforming document processing into a more efficient and accurate operation.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div><img src="/images/blog/how-artificial-intelligence-speeds-data-__66e2025916f03697097a2075_669abe1538a321346b26e574_.png" loading="lazy" alt="Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and AI technology can automatically scan and extract data from brokerage account statements"></div></figure><h3 id="">Direct Data Feeds</h3><p id="">With custodial integrations, seamless portfolio synchronization is achieved through direct data feeds. This means:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Real-time updates on client holdings</li><li id="">Enhanced visibility into held-away assets and external accounts</li></ul><p id="">A comprehensive view of clients' financial situations is maintained without the need for manual data entry. Accurate and timely data ensure reliable portfolio assessments and recommendations.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div><img src="/images/blog/how-artificial-intelligence-speeds-data-__66e2025816f03697097a2059_669abe4aeb9cec77dc66aa95_.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><h3 id="">AI-Driven Risk Assessments</h3><p id="">AI doesn’t just gather data; it makes sense of it. <a href="/blog/improving-risk-tolerance-questionnaires-for-better-financial-planning">Automated risk profiling</a> and data analysis swiftly assess client risk tolerance and financial goals.
