<p id="">Tax season is one of the few times a year when investors actively seek financial advice. They’re looking for ways to reduce their tax bill, maximize deductions, and avoid costly mistakes. For advisors, this creates a prime opportunity to engage new clients and strengthen relationships with existing ones. However, the sheer volume of statements, tax forms, and last-minute requests can make it difficult to keep up—let alone offer proactive, strategic advice.</p><p id="">Traditional tax planning for investment portfolios is time-consuming. Advisors often spend hours manually collecting and entering client data, reviewing cost basis details, and running tax calculations. This slow, fragmented process can lead to delays, making it harder to provide timely recommendations. Prospective clients, eager for immediate answers, may lose patience or confidence in an advisor who can't offer real-time insights.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Investipal eliminates these bottlenecks.</strong> Its <a href="/blog/tag/ai">AI</a>-powered platform scans brokerage statements instantly, extracting key details—holdings, cost basis, unrealized gains and losses, and account types—without the need for manual input. Within minutes, advisors have a complete, structured portfolio view, ready for tax analysis.</p><p id="">From there, Investipal’s automated <strong id="">tax impact analysis</strong> identifies inefficiencies, such as high-fee funds, concentrated positions, and tax-loss harvesting opportunities. This allows advisors to provide clear, data-driven recommendations on how clients can minimize tax drag and optimize their portfolios. Instead of relying on spreadsheets and back-and-forth emails, advisors can deliver insights in real time—when clients need them most.</p><p id="">In this article, we’ll break down how financial advisors can use Investipal to turn tax season into a <strong id="">client acquisition and retention opportunity</strong>. We’ll cover:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Automated portfolio ingestion</strong> for a frictionless <a href="/blog/category/onboarding">onboarding</a> experience</li><li id=""><strong id="">Instant tax transition analysis</strong> to help prospects move portfolios with confidence</li><li id=""><strong id="">Real-time tax impact calculations</strong> to support better decision-making</li><li id=""><strong id="">Year-round tax-loss harvesting</strong> to continuously improve after-tax returns</li><li id=""><strong id="">Tax-optimized portfolio construction</strong> to enhance long-term performance</li></ul><p id="">By leveraging automation, advisors can cut down on manual work, deliver better client experiences, and differentiate themselves from competitors who still rely on slow, outdated methods.</p><h2 id="">Automated Portfolio Ingestion: Simplifying Client Intake</h2><p id="">Bringing on a new client should be an exciting step in the advisory relationship, but too often, the <a href="/blog/category/onboarding">onboarding</a> process is slow and tedious. Traditionally, clients must collect account statements from multiple institutions, send them over, and wait while advisors manually enter holdings, balances, and cost basis details into their planning tools. This back-and-forth can take days, delaying important discussions and creating unnecessary friction in the client experience.</p><p id="">The inefficiency doesn’t just slow down advisors—it can also impact client confidence. A lengthy <a href="/blog/category/onboarding">onboarding</a> process may cause frustration, making it harder to build trust early on. Delays in portfolio analysis mean delays in delivering valuable recommendations, which could be a missed opportunity during critical decision-making periods like tax season.</p><h3 id="">How Investipal Streamlines Client Intake</h3><p id="">Investipal <a href="/blog/using-ocr-technology-to-automate-account-statement-scanning-for-financial-advisors">automates portfolio ingestion</a>, eliminating manual data entry so advisors can move from statement collection to meaningful conversations almost instantly.</p><h3 id="">Instant Statement Parsing</h3><ul id=""><li id="">Instead of manually entering data, advisors or clients upload brokerage statements directly into the system.</li><li id="">AI-powered OCR technology scans and extracts key portfolio details, including holdings, cost basis, unrealized gains/losses, and account types.</li><li id="">Within minutes, a structured portfolio is available, reducing errors and eliminating delays.</li></ul><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/how-financial-advisors-can-use-tax-seaso__67b65ad0b0df9e913c0f96f3_Why_20Customer_20Acquisit.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">Comprehensive Portfolio Overview</h3><ul id=""><li id="">Advisors can quickly assess asset allocation, identify tax inefficiencies, and determine whether certain investments would be better suited in different account types.</li></ul><h3 id="">Eliminating Errors & Saving Time</h3><ul id=""><li id="">Manual entry mistakes—like typos, incorrect cost basis figures, or missing securities—are avoided, ensuring accurate data from the start.</li><li id="">Instead of spending hours on spreadsheets, advisors can immediately focus on strategy, risk assessment, and tax planning.</li></ul><h3 id="">Why It Matters</h3><p id="">A streamlined client intake process isn’t just a convenience—it’s essential to building strong client relationships and improving operational efficiency.</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Faster Insights:</strong> With portfolio data available immediately, advisors can provide timely tax and investment recommendations rather than waiting days for analysis.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Stronger First Impressions:</strong> A seamless intake process demonstrates efficiency and professionalism, reinforcing trust from day one.</li><li id=""><strong id="">More Time for Higher-Value Work:</strong> By automating data entry, advisors can focus on in-depth planning, portfolio optimization, and proactive tax strategies.</li></ul><p id="">By making client intake faster and more efficient, Investipal allows advisors to focus on delivering insights and value—rather than getting bogged down in administrative work.</p><h2 id="">Instant Tax Transition Analysis: Removing Barriers to Moving Portfolios</h2><p id="">For many prospective clients, <strong id="">capital gains taxes</strong> are one of the biggest roadblocks to making portfolio changes. Whether they’re holding a highly appreciated stock, a collection of mutual funds, or an inherited portfolio, they often hesitate to sell due to the fear of a steep tax bill. This uncertainty can keep them locked into an inefficient investment strategy, even when better options are available.</p><p id="">Without the right tools, explaining tax implications can be difficult. Running manual calculations to estimate capital gains takes time, and clients may second-guess decisions if they don’t have clear data in front of them. If an advisor can’t provide an immediate, well-reasoned transition plan, the client may choose to delay—or worse, stick with an outdated portfolio that no longer serves their goals.</p><h3 id="">How Investipal Helps Clients Move Portfolios with Confidence</h3><p id="">Investipal removes guesswork from the conversation by providing <strong id="">instant tax transition analysis</strong>, allowing advisors to model different scenarios and ease concerns about tax liability.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/how-financial-advisors-can-use-tax-seaso__67b65ae29c11ca2d7b19f796_Incorporating_20Client_20.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">Real-Time Capital Gains Estimates</h3><ul id=""><li id="">As soon as a client’s brokerage statements are uploaded, Investipal calculates <strong id="">potential tax consequences</strong> for selling individual positions.</li><li id="">Advisors can quickly show clients <strong id="">exactly how much tax they’d owe</strong> based on their current holdings and tax bracket.</li></ul><h3 id="">Tax-Smart Transition Strategies</h3><ul id=""><li id="">Instead of an all-or-nothing decision, the platform suggests <strong id="">phased selling approaches</strong>—spreading sales over multiple years to keep taxes manageable.</li><li id="">If capital losses are available in the portfolio, Investipal <strong id="">automatically identifies</strong> ways to offset taxable gains.</li></ul><h3 id="">Loss Harvesting Opportunities</h3><ul id=""><li id="">The system flags <strong id="">positions with unrealized losses</strong> that can be used to reduce the impact of gains, helping advisors minimize a client’s tax bill without delay.</li></ul><h3 id="">Practical Scenarios Where This Matters</h3><p id="">These capabilities are especially valuable in situations where clients are hesitant to act:</p><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Exiting High-Fee Mutual Funds</strong><ul id=""><li id="">Many clients want to move out of expensive mutual funds but worry about triggering capital gains taxes. Investipal models a tax-efficient transition, such as <strong id="">selling in stages or offsetting gains with losses</strong>.</li></ul></li><li id=""><strong id="">Reducing Concentrated Stock Positions</strong><ul id=""><li id="">Clients with a <strong id="">large holding in a single stock</strong>—whether from an inheritance, executive compensation, or long-term growth—need a structured plan to gradually diversify without an immediate tax hit.</li></ul></li><li id=""><strong id="">Rebalancing for Retirees</strong><ul id=""><li id="">Retirees often need to rebalance portfolios while <strong id="">minimizing taxable events</strong>. Investipal helps determine whether shifting assets within tax-advantaged accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s) can <strong id="">achieve the right balance without triggering unnecessary capital gains</strong>.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="">Why This Builds Client Trust</h3><p id="">By clearly outlining tax consequences and providing <strong id="">data-backed solutions</strong>, advisors can help clients overcome hesitation and make informed decisions. Instead of vague estimates or uncertainty, clients see a <strong id="">well-structured plan</strong> that makes transitioning their portfolio far less daunting.</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Removes Fear of Tax Surprises:</strong> Clients see exactly what they owe and how to minimize it before making changes.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Encourages Action Instead of Delays:</strong> A clear, tax-efficient transition strategy makes it easier to move forward.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Positions Advisors as Proactive Planners:</strong> Demonstrating tax-smart strategies reinforces an advisor’s expertise and long-term value.</li></ul><p id="">Helping clients move past tax concerns is one of the most effective ways to onboard new assets and strengthen relationships. With <strong id="">instant transition modeling</strong>, Investipal enables advisors to provide clarity, confidence, and a path forward—without unnecessary delays or guesswork.</p><h2 id="">Automated Tax Impact Analysis: Informed Decisions on the Spot</h2><p id="">Tax planning isn’t just about minimizing liabilities—it’s about <strong id="">timing decisions correctly</strong> to maximize after-tax returns. Clients often struggle with <strong id="">when</strong> to buy, sell, or rebalance investments because they don’t have a clear picture of the tax consequences.</p><p id="">Without immediate answers, these questions can stall decision-making. Clients may hold onto inefficient investments longer than they should or second-guess moves that could optimize their portfolio. <strong id="">This is where Investipal’s automated tax impact analysis makes a difference.</strong></p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/how-financial-advisors-can-use-tax-seaso__67b65b2f4d4d92676bcc5abd_Incorporating_20Client_20.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">Providing Instant Clarity During Client Meetings</h3><p id="">Investipal’s real-time tax analysis allows advisors to model different scenarios <strong id="">on the spot</strong>, helping clients make informed decisions without delay.</p><h3 id="">Offsetting Gains with Losses</h3><ul id=""><li id="">If a client has unrealized <strong id="">gains in one part of their portfolio</strong>, Investipal immediately scans for <strong id="">unrealized losses</strong> elsewhere that could be used to offset the tax impact.</li><li id="">This makes tax-loss harvesting more strategic and <strong id="">easier to execute year-round, rather than only at year-end.</strong></li></ul><h3 id="">Why Real-Time Tax Analysis Builds Trust</h3><p id=""><strong id="">1. Clients See Data-Backed Insights, Not Guesswork</strong></p><ul id=""><li id="">Instead of general advice like “You might owe more if you sell now,” clients get <strong id="">concrete numbers</strong> to support their decision.</li></ul><p id=""><strong id="">2. It Helps Clients Take Action Instead of Hesitating</strong></p><ul id=""><li id="">Many investors delay decisions out of uncertainty. When they can compare different scenarios instantly, <strong id="">they feel more confident moving forward.</strong></li></ul><p id=""><strong id="">3. It Reinforces the Advisor’s Expertise</strong></p><ul id=""><li id="">Showing clients <strong id="">real-time tax implications</strong> demonstrates a <strong id="">level of precision and strategic thinking</strong> that sets an advisor apart from competitors who rely on slow, manual methods.</li></ul><h3 id="">Advisors Gain an Edge in Volatile Markets</h3><p id="">Tax impact analysis is especially valuable during <strong id="">market fluctuations</strong>. When stocks dip, clients may wonder whether it’s a good time to sell or reposition their portfolio. Instead of waiting days for an answer, advisors using Investipal can:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Instantly model <strong id="">tax-efficient rebalancing strategies</strong> to minimize capital gains taxes.</li><li id="">Identify <strong id="">tax-loss harvesting opportunities</strong> that weren’t available before the downturn.</li><li id="">Adjust <strong id="">withdrawal and contribution strategies</strong> based on updated market conditions.</li></ul><p id="">With real-time tax insights, advisors don’t just react to market conditions—they proactively guide clients through them. By integrating tax-smart decision-making into every portfolio move, they create <strong id="">more value, build stronger relationships, and ensure that tax efficiency becomes a year-round priority.</strong></p><h2 id="">Building Tax-Optimized Portfolios from the Outset</h2><p id="">A portfolio’s <strong id="">headline return</strong> doesn’t tell the full story. Even a strong-performing portfolio can be <strong id="">dragged down by taxes</strong> if asset location, rebalancing, and withdrawal strategies aren’t carefully managed. Too often, advisors focus solely on <strong id="">asset allocation</strong> without optimizing for tax efficiency—leaving clients with unnecessary tax liabilities that erode long-term gains.</p><p id="">By incorporating <strong id="">tax optimization from day one</strong>, advisors can help clients keep more of their investment returns, avoid costly restructuring down the road, and ensure their portfolio is positioned for <strong id="">long-term, after-tax growth</strong>.</p><h3 id="">Key Components of a Tax-Smart Portfolio</h3><p id="">Investipal provides <strong id="">automated guidance</strong> to help advisors structure portfolios for maximum tax efficiency, focusing on three core areas:</p><h3 id="">1. Asset Location: Placing Investments in the Right Accounts</h3><ul id=""><li id="">Not all investment income is taxed equally, which is why <strong id="">where an asset is held matters just as much as what’s in the portfolio.</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Taxable Accounts (Brokerage Accounts):</strong> Best suited for long-term capital appreciation strategies, like individual stocks and tax-efficient ETFs, where gains qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRAs, 401(k)s, RRSPs):</strong> More appropriate for interest-bearing bonds, REITs, and actively traded funds to shield clients from unnecessary annual taxes on dividends and interest.</li></ul><h3 id="">2. Rebalancing with Minimal Tax Consequences</h3><ul id=""><li id="">Regular portfolio rebalancing can trigger taxable events, especially when done in <strong id="">taxable brokerage accounts</strong>.</li><li id="">Investipal automatically suggests rebalancing <strong id="">within tax-deferred accounts</strong> whenever possible to avoid generating <strong id="">capital gains taxes unnecessarily.</strong></li><li id="">When rebalancing in a taxable account is necessary, the system identifies the <strong id="">most tax-efficient way to do so</strong>, minimizing realized gains and maximizing opportunities for tax-loss harvesting.</li></ul><h3 id="">3. Withdrawal Sequencing for Retirees</h3><ul id=""><li id="">Many retirees withdraw funds in an <strong id="">unstructured manner</strong>, leading to <strong id="">higher lifetime taxes</strong> than necessary.</li><li id="">Investipal helps model different <strong id="">withdrawal sequencing strategies</strong> to reduce overall tax exposure, such as:<ul id=""><li id="">Prioritizing <strong id="">taxable account withdrawals first</strong> to allow tax-advantaged accounts more time to compound.</li><li id="">Strategically converting funds to Roth IRAs in lower-income years to reduce Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) later.</li><li id="">Balancing withdrawals across different account types to keep clients in a lower tax bracket.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="">How Investipal Makes Tax Optimization Easy</h3><p id="">Tax-efficient investing requires <strong id="">constant awareness of tax laws, account types, and client-specific goals</strong>—which can be overwhelming without automation. Investipal simplifies the process with:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Automated Portfolio Construction</strong>: Instantly flags where each asset <strong id="">should be placed</strong> for maximum after-tax returns.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Scenario Comparisons</strong>: Provides side-by-side projections for different tax strategies, such as whether a client would benefit from keeping a fund in a <strong id="">taxable account vs. an IRA</strong>.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Multi-Year Tax Planning</strong>: Models how small adjustments today can compound into significant tax savings over time, helping advisors make <strong id="">better long-term recommendations</strong>.</li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div><img src="/images/blog/how-financial-advisors-can-use-tax-seaso__67b660d937cc3b057c78b73c_Incorporating_20Client_20.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit"></div></figure><h3 id="">Why Tax Optimization from the Start Matters</h3><p id="">Many advisors wait until a client’s portfolio <strong id="">becomes inefficient</strong> before addressing tax issues. But by proactively <strong id="">building tax-smart portfolios from day one</strong>, clients benefit from:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Fewer Tax Surprises</strong>: No sudden liquidation events that create unexpected tax burdens.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Higher After-Tax Returns</strong>: Tax drag is minimized, allowing more wealth to compound.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Reduced Need for Major Portfolio Restructuring</strong>: Strategic asset placement ensures long-term efficiency.</li></ul><p id="">By <strong id="">integrating tax optimization into the portfolio design process</strong>, advisors can help clients <strong id="">retain more of their gains, avoid unnecessary tax bills, and improve long-term financial outcomes</strong>. With <strong id="">Investipal’s automated guidance</strong>, tax-efficient investing becomes seamless—no spreadsheets or manual calculations required.</p><h2 id="">Reaching and Educating Clients During Tax Season—and After</h2><p id="">Tax season naturally draws investors' attention to their finances. As they gather tax forms, review capital gains, and assess their overall tax burden, many start questioning whether they could be doing more to reduce what they owe. This heightened awareness makes it an ideal time for advisors to engage, offering proactive solutions that help clients make <strong id="">smarter tax decisions—not just for this year, but for the long term</strong>.</p><p id="">However, engagement shouldn’t stop once tax season ends. <strong id="">Advisors who continue providing tax-smart insights throughout the year position themselves as proactive partners rather than seasonal consultants.</strong> A well-structured, ongoing communication strategy ensures that clients see your value long after April.</p><h3 id="">Making a Strong Impression During Tax Season</h3><p id="">With clients already focused on taxes, this is the perfect time to demonstrate your expertise and introduce tools that simplify tax-efficient investing.</p><h3 id="">Offer a Brief Tax Review</h3><ul id=""><li id="">Invite clients and prospects to <strong id="">upload their brokerage statements</strong> into Investipal for a <strong id="">quick tax-efficiency checkup</strong>.</li><li id="">Even a <strong id="">basic portfolio snapshot</strong> showing unrealized gains, tax-inefficient holdings, or tax-loss harvesting opportunities can open the door to deeper discussions.</li></ul><h3 id="">Keep Explanations Actionable & Simple</h3><ul id=""><li id="">Instead of overwhelming clients with complex tax jargon, highlight <strong id="">a few practical strategies</strong>, such as:<ul id=""><li id="">Moving high-dividend funds to an IRA or 401(k) to reduce tax drag.</li><li id="">Gradually selling a concentrated stock position over multiple years to <strong id="">minimize capital gains taxes</strong>.</li><li id="">Offsetting gains with losses to <strong id="">lower overall taxable income</strong>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="">Provide Ongoing Tax-Smart Tips</h3><ul id=""><li id="">A short, <strong id="">value-packed email series</strong> with actionable tax-saving ideas can keep clients engaged.</li><li id="">Example topics:<ul id=""><li id="">“Three Moves to Reduce Your 2025 Capital Gains Taxes”</li><li id="">“How to Keep More of Your Returns with Smarter Asset Location”</li><li id="">“Year-Round Tax-Loss Harvesting: Why December Isn’t the Only Time to Act”</li></ul></li></ul><p id="">Even small educational efforts like these reinforce <strong id="">your expertise and ongoing value.</strong></p><h3 id="">Maintaining Engagement Beyond Tax Season</h3><p id="">Many advisors disappear after April, only to reappear next tax season. But staying <strong id="">proactively engaged throughout the year</strong> strengthens relationships, keeps clients informed, and helps them make smarter financial moves.</p><h3 id="">Follow Up Post-Tax Season</h3><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Check in on potential portfolio transitions</strong> while tax season is fresh in clients' minds.</li><li id="">Some investors may have delayed taking action due to <strong id="">uncertainty around capital gains taxes</strong>—<strong id="">now is the time to revisit those discussions</strong>.</li><li id="">Offer a mid-year review to ensure their investment strategy aligns with the latest tax laws and market conditions.</li></ul><h3 id="">Keep Clients Informed on Portfolio & Tax Policy Updates</h3><ul id=""><li id="">If <strong id="">markets dip mid-year</strong>, a quick note about potential <strong id="">tax-loss harvesting opportunities</strong> can provide real-time value.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Regulatory changes</strong> in tax laws, contribution limits, or retirement planning rules are another chance to reconnect with clients and provide relevant guidance.</li></ul><h3 id="">Personalized, Strategic Outreach</h3><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Tie tax-smart moves to key life events.</strong><ul id=""><li id="">If a client’s birthday, work anniversary, or business transition coincides with a <strong id="">Roth conversion opportunity or a good time to rebalance</strong>, use that as a reason to reach out.</li><li id="">This personalized approach blends financial planning with <strong id="">relationship-building</strong>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="">Why Ongoing Communication Matters</h3><p id="">By maintaining consistent, <strong id="">relevant</strong> client engagement, advisors position themselves as <strong id="">trusted, proactive partners</strong>—not just once a year, but <strong id="">whenever financial decisions arise</strong>.</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Advisors who provide tax-saving strategies year-round are seen as indispensable.</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Clients who hear from their advisor more than once a year are more likely to stay engaged, retain assets, and refer others.</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Proactive communication builds trust, strengthens relationships, and creates long-term loyalty.</strong></li></ul><p id="">Instead of viewing tax season as a once-a-year push, <strong id="">use it as an opportunity to spark conversations that continue throughout the year.</strong> By leveraging automation, timely check-ins, and personalized outreach, you stay top-of-mind as an advisor who <strong id="">not only reacts to client needs but anticipates them.</strong></p><h2 id="">Turning Tax Efficiency into a Lasting Differentiator</h2><p id="">Tax time can be hectic, but it also brings an amplified focus on financial decisions.</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Investors:</strong> They want practical, reliable ways to keep more of their returns.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Advisors:</strong> Seeking tools that let them respond quickly, handle complex calculations, and offer crystal-clear guidance.</li></ul><h3 id="">How Investipal Fits In</h3><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Automation Reduces Friction:</strong> By scanning statements and providing instant analysis, you remove much of the wait and uncertainty.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Data-Backed Insights:</strong> Clients appreciate seeing numbers rather than vague assurances, which boosts your credibility.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Year-Round Value:</strong> Beyond the initial onboarding and tax season, continuous monitoring for loss harvesting and strategic rebalancing stays relevant month after month.</li></ol><p id="">When you integrate these capabilities into your practice, clients see you as someone who is both efficient and deeply informed. You’re not just guessing about taxes; you’re showing them concrete pathways to save money. Over time, that reputation can lead to more referrals, higher retention, and an ever-growing book of business.</p><p id="">A strong tax focus doesn’t have to be just a seasonal push. By weaving these automated tools and strategies into your ongoing service, you create a compelling, consistent message: you help clients keep more of their investments, period.
