## <a href="/blog/tag/ai">AI</a> is changing the industry

<a href="/blog/tag/ai">AI</a> is changing wealth management, from financial planning to investment management and client relationships. A report by McKinsey & Company found that <a href="/blog/tag/ai">AI</a> can increase [productivity](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/how-artificial-intelligence-can-deliver-real-value-to-companies) in wealth management companies by 30% to 40%. This evolution helps smaller firms compete better against larger ones and close the productivity gap. As a result, financial advisors leveraging these technologies can manage 40% [more](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2018/04/11/advisors-using-<a href="/blog/tag/ai">ai</a>-manage-40-more-in-aum-study/) assets than those who don't. Moreover, integrating <a href="/blog/tag/ai">AI</a> tools also allows firms to offer greater personalization for clients. This is important because 68% of people would [switch financial advisors](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2018/04/11/advisors-using-<a href="/blog/tag/ai">ai</a>-manage-40-more-in-aum-study/) for better tech capabilities.

## Client relationship management

As technology advances, so do client expectations. Today, clients want more timely, accurate, and personalized advice that fits their unique financial goals and risk tolerance. An EY survey shows 60% of clients desire personalized services from <a href="/segments/wealth-managers">wealth managers</a>, highlighting the growing importance of [customization](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/wealth-asset-management/how-can-wealth-managers-satisfy-clients-demand-for-personalization) in client relationship management. Meeting these expectations can be challenging, especially with a large client base.

AI augments client relationship management with better analysis, deeper insights, and predictive analytics. This allows financial advisors to handle client information more efficiently, identify patterns, predict client needs, and offer a more personalized advisory experience. For instance, AI helps in creating tailored investment portfolios, providing specific financial planning advice, and addressing client concerns promptly. An Accenture study reveals that AI could increase client satisfaction by 26% and revenue by 34% in the wealth management industry through improved [personalization](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-115/Accenture-Wealth-Management-AI-Report-2018.pdf). Embracing AI in client relationship management enables financial advisors to meet clients' demands effectively and cultivate lasting relationships for business growth.

## Risk management and compliance

In addition to enhancing client relationship management and personalized advice, AI and ML serve as essential components for risk management and compliance in wealth management. With increasing regulatory scrutiny and complex financial markets, managing risk and ensuring compliance have become critical challenges for financial advisors. According to a survey by Thomson Reuters, 53% of financial firms expect their compliance budgets to increase in response to [growing regulatory pressures](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/resources/special-reports/cost-of-compliance-2020.html).

AI and ML technologies can significantly improve risk management and compliance processes by automating time-consuming tasks, identifying potential risks, and ensuring adherence to regulatory standards. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI can detect patterns and anomalies that might indicate fraudulent activities, market manipulation, or other compliance issues. Moreover, AI-powered tools can monitor transactions in real-time, enabling financial advisors to take proactive measures and mitigate risks more effectively. A report by PwC found that 52% of financial services firms have adopted AI for risk and compliance functions, with 77% of them reporting [improved efficiency and effectiveness](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/advisory/consulting/risk/ai-in-risk-and-compliance-survey-2021.pdf). By leveraging AI for risk management and compliance, financial advisors can not only ensure regulatory compliance but also protect their clients' interests and build trust in their advisory practices.

## Closing the productivity gap

Furthermore, implementing AI solutions also enhances productivity in financial advisory services, an area where smaller firms have been struggling to keep up with their larger counterparts. According to a report by McKinsey, productivity growth in the wealth management industry [has been declining](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/how-smaller-wealth-managers-can-thrive-in-a-scale-obsessed-world), with smaller firms facing a more significant challenge due to their limited resources and scale.

AI-powered tools can significantly improve productivity by automating routine tasks, streamlining data processing, and providing quick access to relevant information. This enables financial advisors to spend less time on administrative tasks and focus more on strategic decision-making and client interactions. For instance, AI can automate tasks such as data entry, report generation, and client communications, freeing up valuable time for advisors. A study by Autonomous Research estimates that AI and automation can help financial advisors [save up to 40% of their time](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2018/04/11/advisors-using-ai-manage-40-more-in-aum-study/), allowing them to focus on higher-value activities. By embracing AI solutions to enhance productivity, smaller advisory firms can better compete with larger firms, ultimately driving growth and success in the fast-evolving financial landscape.

## AI for marketing and growth

Building on the productivity gains enabled by AI, financial advisory firms, particularly smaller ones, can reinvest their time and resources into growth initiatives. This is important since the fastest-growing firms are [no longer relying solely on referrals](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/09/23/top-advisors-are-investing-in-digital-marketing-are-you/) but are actively investing in digital growth strategies.

Augmenting traditional marketing, AI-powered tools drive top-funnel activity by increasing personalization, accelerating content creation, and optimizing campaigns, leading to higher bottom-funnel conversion rates and smoother <a href="/features/client-acquisition">client onboarding</a>. For example, clients can complete a [risk questionnaire](/portfolio-risk-assessment), and AI-driven personalization and automation generate a draft <a href="/features/investment-policy-statements">Investment Policy Statement</a> (IPS) and proposal based on their risk tolerance, risk capacity, and current holdings. With 90% of the materials and information ready, advisors can focus on building strong relationships and closing the business. Once closed, AI automates portfolio allocation and follow-ups, allowing advisors to dedicate more time to fostering relationships and closing more deals, ultimately driving growth and creating a positive feedback loop.
