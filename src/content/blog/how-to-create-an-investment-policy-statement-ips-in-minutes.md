<p id="">For financial advisors, creating an <a href="/features/investment-policy-statements">Investment Policy Statement</a> (IPS) can be one of those time-consuming tasks that takes them away from what they do best—working with clients. Gathering information, defining investment strategies, and ensuring compliance can take hours. But what if there were a faster way to create a high-quality, compliant IPS? That’s where Investipal’s <a href="/blog/how-ai-is-changing-investment-policy-statements" id="">AI-powered IPS generator</a> comes in. With this tool, creating an IPS doesn’t have to be a headache—it can be done in minutes.</p><h2 id="">What Is an Investment Policy Statement (IPS)?</h2><p id="">An<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ips.asp" id=""> Investment Policy Statement (IPS)</a> is like a blueprint for a client’s financial future. It outlines their investment goals, risk tolerance, and the strategies the advisor will use to help them achieve those goals. For financial advisors, an IPS is essential for setting expectations and guiding investment decisions, especially when market conditions change.</p><p id="">In addition to being a guide for the advisor and client, an IPS also helps ensure compliance with regulations like Reg BI. It shows that the advisor’s recommendations are based on a clear, documented strategy that aligns with the client’s best interests.</p><h2 id="">The Challenges of Creating an IPS Manually</h2><p id="">Creating an IPS manually can be challenging for several reasons:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">It Takes Time</strong>: Advisors need to collect detailed client information, think through investment strategies, and then write it all out. This can take hours, especially when tailoring the IPS to each client’s unique situation.</li><li id=""><strong id="">There’s Room for Error</strong>: Manually creating an IPS means there’s a higher chance of making mistakes. Errors in an IPS can lead to confusion or even compliance issues later on.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Staying Compliant Is Hard</strong>: Regulations like Reg BI are always changing, and keeping up with them is a full-time job. Ensuring that every IPS complies with these regulations can add a layer of complexity that most advisors don’t have time for.</li></ul><p id="">But what if there were a way to automate this process?</p><h2 id="">How Investipal’s AI-Powered IPS Generator Solves These Problems</h2><p id="">Investipal’s IPS generator uses artificial intelligence (AI) to simplify the entire process.
