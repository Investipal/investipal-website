<p id="">Compliance is a constant concern for RIAs (Registered Investment Advisors) and independent advisors. With rising regulatory requirements—especially under the <strong id="">SEC Marketing Rule</strong>, <strong id=""><a href="/features/regulation-best-interest-generator">Reg BI</a></strong> (<a href="" id="">Regulation Best Interest</a>), and <strong id="">KYC</strong> (Know Your Client)—maintaining compliance while running a profitable advisory practice can be challenging. Yet, automating key parts of your sales process can transform how you handle compliance. It can save time, reduce errors, and allow you to focus on what really matters: growing your client base and delivering value.</p><p id="">In this guide, we’ll explore how financial advisors can use automation to enhance compliance throughout the sales process and why <strong id="">Investipal</strong> should be part of your tech stack.</p><h2 id="">Understanding the SEC Marketing Rule and Its Implications for RIAs</h2><p id="">The <strong id="">SEC Marketing Rule</strong> (Rule 206(4)-1) introduced much-needed flexibility in how RIAs and financial advisors can market their services. It allows the use of testimonials, endorsements, and third-party ratings in advertising, provided they meet specific disclosure standards. Similarly, performance metrics can be included in marketing, but they must be fair, balanced, and backed by supporting data.</p><p id="">However, the rule demands thorough documentation. Every marketing claim, performance metric, or testimonial must be archived and available for audit. This increases the compliance burden, requiring systems that ensure all client-facing content meets SEC standards.</p><p id=""><strong id="">How Automation Helps</strong>:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Automatic Archiving</strong>: Investipal's tools ensure marketing materials are stored securely, simplifying compliance audits.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Performance Reporting</strong>: Automated reports on portfolio performance ensure all claims are backed by real-time data.</li></ul><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/how-to-automate-sales-and-compliance-for__66e498056668c8526b2086e1_66e495f7bb82faf14a58a8bd_.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h2 id="">The Burden of Compliance for Financial Advisors</h2><p id="">Beyond the SEC Marketing Rule, other regulations like <strong id="">Reg BI</strong> and <strong id="">KYC</strong> add layers of complexity to the advisory business. Managing compliance for these rules takes significant time and resources. Many advisors spend up to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/how-do-financial-advisors-spend-time-research-study-productivity-capacity-efficiency/" id=""><strong id="">15 hours per week</strong></a> on compliance tasks, reducing time for client acquisition and relationship building.</p><p id="">Additionally, client acquisition costs have <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.kitces.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/The-Kitces-Report-Marketing-Survey-How-Financial-Planners-Actually-Market-Their-Services-Vol-1-2024.pdf" id="">surged by <strong id="">71%</strong> since 2021</a>, partly due to these growing compliance burdens. Advisors are spending more on marketing and more time on manual processes to meet regulatory standards.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2240px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2240px"><div id=""><img src="/images/blog/how-to-automate-sales-and-compliance-for__66e498066668c8526b2086f5_66e4961581ebba6b8be8d2f8_.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3 id="">Common Compliance Issues in Traditional Sales Processes</h3><p id="">In a traditional sales setup, advisors often spend too much time manually preparing compliance documents, such as:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Investment Policy Statements (IPS)</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Reg BI reports</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">KYC forms</strong></li></ul><p id="">This process is prone to errors.
