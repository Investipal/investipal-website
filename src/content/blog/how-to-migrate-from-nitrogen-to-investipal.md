## Why Advisors Migrate from Nitrogen

Before diving into the how, it's worth understanding why firms make the switch. Based on conversations with advisors who've migrated, the most common drivers include:

**1. Tool Consolidation**
Nitrogen (Riskalyze) excels at risk assessment and proposals, but most firms still need separate tools for statement aggregation, IPS generation, client onboarding and e-signature, and portfolio management. According to <a href="https://www.kitces.com/blog/advisor-fintech-map-wealthtech-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry research</a>, the average RIA uses 5-7 separate software platforms. Investipal consolidates these workflows into one platform - including a [client portal](/features/client-acquisition) for digital onboarding, e-signature, and advisory agreement execution - enabling true advisor tech stack consolidation and reducing software costs and context switching.

**2. Statement Scanning Limitations**
Nitrogen's (Riskalyze's) statement scanning supports major custodians but struggles with smaller brokerages, international accounts, or complex formats. Advisors working with prospects who have held-away assets often spend hours manually re-keying data. Investipal's [AI-powered statement scanner](/features/automated-statement-scanner) handles 50+ brokerage formats, including complex multi-page statements.

**3. Compliance Workflow Gaps**
Creating IPS documentation in Nitrogen (Riskalyze) requires separate workflows and re-entering client data. Investipal generates proposals and [IPS](/features/investment-policy-statements) from the same data source in one unified workflow.

**4. Alternative Investment Support**
Advisors serving high-net-worth clients with private equity, real estate, structured products, or annuities find Nitrogen's (Riskalyze's) portfolio modeling limited. Investipal includes a custom security builder for modeling alternatives within the same optimization engine, plus a comprehensive [annuity and IUL modeling tool](/features/iul-annuity-modeling) for advisors working with insurance products.

If you're evaluating whether to migrate, see our detailed [Investipal vs Nitrogen comparison](/blog/investipal-vs-nitrogen-riskalyze-comparison) for a complete feature breakdown.

## Migration Overview: What to Expect

**Typical Timeline for Nitrogen (Riskalyze) Migration:** 2-4 weeks from kickoff to go-live

**Key Phases:**
1. **Planning & Data Export** (Week 1): Inventory your Nitrogen setup, export data, plan migration approach
2. **Model & Template Recreation** (Week 1-2): Rebuild investment models, proposal templates, and IPS formats in Investipal
3. **Parallel Testing** (Week 2-3): Run 3-5 test cases through both systems to validate accuracy
4. **Team Training** (Week 3-4): Train advisors and operations staff on Investipal workflows
5. **Go-Live** (Week 4): Cutover to Investipal for all new client engagements

**Resource Requirements:**
- **Decision maker time:** 2-4 hours (planning, approval, go-live decision)
- **Operations lead time:** 10-15 hours (data export, model recreation, testing)
- **Advisor training time:** 2-3 hours per advisor (initial training + practice workflows)

**With Managed Migration:** Investipal's team handles model recreation and documentation setup, reducing your internal time investment by 60-70%.

## Pre-Migration Planning (Week 1)

### Step 1: Inventory Your Current Nitrogen Setup

Before exporting any data, document what you're currently using:

**Client Data:**
- Number of active client households in Nitrogen
- Number of prospects with saved risk assessments
- Custom client segments or tags

**Investment Models:**
- List of investment models (conservative, moderate, aggressive, etc.)
- Asset allocation templates
- Custom risk ranges for each model
- Benchmark selections

**Proposal Templates:**
- Branded proposal layouts
- Standard disclosures and footnotes
- IPS templates (if using Nitrogen's IPS module)
- Any custom reporting formats

**Integrations:**
- CRM integrations (Redtail, Salesforce, Wealthbox)
- Custodian connections
- Data feeds from portfolio accounting systems

**Tip:** Create a simple spreadsheet listing all models, templates, and integrations. This becomes your migration checklist.

### Step 2: Identify Your Migration Approach

**Option A: Self-Service Migration**
You handle data export, model recreation, and setup. Investipal provides documentation, video tutorials, and support via email/chat. Best for smaller firms (1-3 advisors) with straightforward setups.

**Option B: Managed Migration (Recommended)**
Investipal's team manages the technical migration. You provide sample proposals, IPS documents, and model specifications. We recreate everything in Investipal and hand it back to you ready to use. Best for firms with 4+ advisors, complex models, or limited internal tech resources.

### Step 3: Set Your Go-Live Date

Choose a realistic timeline based on firm size:
- **1-2 advisors:** 2 weeks
- **3-5 advisors:** 3 weeks
- **6+ advisors or complex setups:** 4 weeks

**Avoid** go-live during high-volume periods (tax season, year-end planning, etc.). Ideal times: early Q1, late Q2, or early Q4.

## Data Export from Nitrogen (Riskalyze)

Nitrogen (formerly Riskalyze) allows you to export client data, risk assessments, and portfolio information. Here's what you'll need:

### Exporting Client Risk Scores from Nitrogen

**Step 1:** Log into Nitrogen and navigate to your client list

**Step 2:** Export client data to CSV
- Go to **Clients** → **Export**
- Select fields: Client Name, Email, Risk Number, Date of Last Assessment
- Download CSV file

**Step 3:** Clean the data
- Remove any test accounts or inactive clients
- Ensure email addresses are formatted correctly (required for Investipal import)
- Verify Risk Numbers are within expected ranges (1-99)

**Sample CSV format:**
```
Client Name, Email, Risk Number, Assessment Date
John Smith, jsmith@email.com, 65, 2025-10-15
Jane Doe, jdoe@email.com, 42, 2025-09-22
```

### Exporting Investment Models from Nitrogen/Riskalyze

Nitrogen's (Riskalyze's) models contain asset allocations, risk parameters, and benchmarks. You'll need:

**For each model:**
- Model name
- Target asset allocation (% stocks, bonds, alternatives, cash)
- Risk Number range
- Expected return and standard deviation assumptions
- Benchmark index selection
- Underlying funds or securities

**How to export:**
1. Navigate to **Proposals** → **Models**
2. Screenshot or document each model's allocation
3. Export holdings lists for each model if available
4. Note any custom risk assumptions or constraints

**Alternatively:** Nitrogen support can provide a bulk export of model data upon request. Contact them directly for assistance.

### Exporting Sample Proposals and IPS Documents

To recreate your branded templates in Investipal, you'll need examples of your current output:

**Collect 2-3 sample proposals:**
- Different risk profiles (conservative, moderate, aggressive)
- Different client scenarios (retiree, accumulator, high-net-worth)
- Note branding elements: logo placement, color scheme, disclosures

**Collect sample IPS documents:**
- Standard IPS templates for each client type
- Custom language or disclosures specific to your firm
- Compliance review notes or required sections

**Save as PDFs:** Investipal's team will use these to replicate your format and language during managed migration.

## Importing Client Risk Scores

Investipal supports bulk import of client risk assessment data via CSV upload. This eliminates the need to re-assess every client manually.

### Bulk Import Process

**Step 1:** Prepare your CSV file

Your exported Nitrogen data needs to map to Investipal's import format:

```
Client Name, Email, Risk Score, Assessment Date
```

**Field mapping:**
- **Nitrogen Risk Number** → **Investipal Risk Score** (1-100 scale)
- **Assessment Date** → Used for record-keeping and compliance

**Step 2:** Upload to Investipal

1. Navigate to **Clients** → **Import**
2. Select "Risk Assessment Import"
3. Upload your CSV file
4. Map columns to Investipal fields
5. Review preview and confirm import

**Step 3:** Validate imported data

Investipal will flag any issues:
- Missing required fields (email, risk score)
- Out-of-range risk scores
- Duplicate client records

Review flagged items and make corrections before finalizing import.

**Result:** All client risk assessments are now in Investipal, preserving historical data and eliminating re-assessment work.

### How Risk Scores Transfer to Investipal

Nitrogen (Riskalyze) uses a 1-99 Risk Number scale. Investipal offers two ways to define client risk:
1. **Use Investipal's risk assessment** - A comprehensive questionnaire that evaluates behavioral tolerance, risk capacity, and portfolio characteristics
2. **Manually define a risk score** - Directly input a risk number for the client

During migration, your Nitrogen/Riskalyze Risk Numbers are imported as **manually defined scores** in Investipal. This means:
- The risk number transfers exactly as-is (no recalculation needed)
- Clients don't need to retake any risk assessments
- The score remains in place until you choose to update it using Investipal's assessment tool

**Why this matters:** Zero disruption to clients. Their risk profile stays exactly the same until you decide to leverage Investipal's more comprehensive risk assessment for future updates or reviews.

## Recreating Investment Models

Your investment models are the heart of your advisory process. The good news: recreating them in Investipal is simpler than you might think.

### What Investipal Needs to Recreate Your Models

**All we need is your holdings list.** That's it.

For each model, provide:
- List of holdings with target allocations
  - Ticker symbols or fund names
  - Target percentage for each holding

You'll name the models whatever you like when setting them up in Investipal (e.g., "Conservative Growth," "Moderate Balanced," etc.). The holdings are what matter.

**Example format:**
```
Conservative Growth Model:
- VFIAX (Vanguard 500 Index): 35%
- VBTLX (Vanguard Total Bond): 50%
- VTMGX (Vanguard Developed Markets): 10%
- Cash: 5%
```

**What about alternatives and annuities?**
If your models include alternative investments or insurance products that Nitrogen couldn't model properly, you can include those too. Investipal's custom security builder and [annuity modeling capabilities](/features/iul-annuity-modeling) mean you can finally incorporate these holdings into your models alongside traditional securities.

**Optional: Historical Performance Data**
If you want to recreate exact historical performance for backtesting or client reporting, you can provide:
- Historical trade files
- Performance data from Nitrogen
- Returns by time period

This is optional but helpful if clients are used to seeing specific performance history.

### Self-Service Model Recreation

**Step 1:** Navigate to **Models** → **Create New Model**

**Step 2:** Enter model name and holdings list
- Input each ticker/fund
- Set target allocation percentages
- Investipal automatically calculates asset class breakdowns

**Step 3:** Save and test
- Generate a test proposal to verify the model works as expected

**Time per model:** 5-10 minutes for most models.

### Managed Migration: Model Recreation by Investipal

With managed migration, you simply provide your holdings lists and we handle the rest.

**What you provide:**
- Holdings with target allocations for each model (spreadsheet or export from Nitrogen)
- Optional: Historical performance data if you want to preserve it

You can provide model names if it helps keep track, but it's not required - you'll name them in Investipal as you set them up.

**What Investipal delivers:**
- Fully configured models ready to use
- Side-by-side comparison showing Nitrogen vs. Investipal to verify accuracy
- Test proposals demonstrating output

**Timeline:** 2-3 business days for most firms. Even complex setups with 10+ models typically complete within 5 business days.

**Cost:** Complimentary with your Investipal subscription.

## Migrating Proposals and Documentation

Your proposal format is part of your brand. Investipal's proposal builder is highly customizable to match your current Nitrogen output.

### Proposal Template Migration

Investipal's template builder makes it easy to recreate your Nitrogen proposal format yourself. The drag-and-drop interface lets you configure:
- Logo and firm branding
- Color schemes and fonts
- Section layout (executive summary, risk analysis, allocation, holdings, disclosures)
- Custom disclosures and footnotes
- Specific language and formatting

**Self-Service Approach:**
1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Proposal Templates**
2. Use the visual template builder to configure sections
3. Upload your logo and set brand colors
4. Add your custom disclosures
5. Preview with sample client data
6. Save and use across all proposals

**Time to recreate:** 20-30 minutes for most firms.

**Need assistance?** While the template builder is designed to be intuitive, our team is happy to help recreate your templates if you prefer. We can match your current format or help enhance it with improved visualizations while maintaining your brand identity.

### IPS Template Migration

Investipal's [automated IPS generation](/features/investment-policy-statements) creates Investment Policy Statements from the same data used for proposals.

**The template builder approach:**

Like proposals, you can easily recreate your IPS template using Investipal's IPS template builder:
1. Navigate to **Settings** → **IPS Templates**
2. Configure standard sections (objectives, constraints, allocation policy, rebalancing, etc.)
3. Add your firm-specific language and compliance-approved disclosures
4. Set formatting preferences
5. Test with sample client data

**Time to recreate:** 20-30 minutes.

**Need assistance?** Our team can help configure your IPS templates to match your current format and ensure all compliance requirements are met. Just provide 2-3 sample IPS documents and we'll assist with setup.

**Result:** IPS documents are now auto-generated alongside proposals from the same data source, eliminating the separate workflow required in Nitrogen. No re-entering client information or investment parameters.

## Parallel Testing (Week 2-3)

Before cutting over completely, run parallel workflows in both Nitrogen (Riskalyze) and Investipal to validate accuracy and build confidence.

### Testing Protocol

**Select 3-5 test cases representing different scenarios:**
1. **Conservative retiree** with simple portfolio (bonds, dividend stocks)
2. **Moderate accumulator** with standard 60/40 allocation
3. **Aggressive growth** with higher equity exposure
4. **Complex portfolio** with alternatives or concentrated positions
5. **Existing client** for whom you have a recent Nitrogen proposal

**For each test case:**

**Step 1:** Create proposal in both Nitrogen and Investipal

**Step 2:** Compare outputs side-by-side
- Asset allocation percentages
- Risk scores and projections
- Fee calculations
- Expected returns and standard deviation
- Holdings list and position sizes

**Step 3:** Document any discrepancies
- Are differences due to different optimization algorithms?
- Are risk assumptions equivalent?
- Do both meet client objectives?

**Step 4:** Generate IPS in both systems (if using Nitrogen IPS)
- Compare structure and content
- Validate all client data populated correctly

**Step 5:** Time the workflow
- How long does each system take from statement upload to final proposal?
- Are there steps that are faster/slower in each platform?

### Validation Checklist

Use this checklist for each test case:

```
☐ Client risk assessment matches or is within acceptable range
☐ Proposed portfolio allocation aligns with model specifications
☐ Holdings list is accurate and implementable
☐ Risk/return projections are reasonable
☐ Fees calculated correctly
☐ Proposal formatting meets brand standards
☐ IPS generated with accurate client data
☐ Workflow completed in acceptable timeframe
☐ Advisor comfortable with Investipal process
```

**Goal:** 95%+ match on quantitative metrics (allocations, risk scores, fees). Some variation in projections is expected due to different methodologies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Isn't Nitrogen the same as Riskalyze?

Yes. Riskalyze rebranded to Nitrogen in 2021. This migration guide applies to both the Nitrogen and Riskalyze platforms - they are the same product with the same underlying technology. If you're searching for "how to migrate from Riskalyze to Investipal," you're in the right place. All instructions, data export processes, and migration steps are identical whether you know the platform as Nitrogen or Riskalyze.

### How long does migration take?

Typical timeline is 2-4 weeks from kickoff to go-live for migrating from Nitrogen (Riskalyze). Smaller firms (1-2 advisors) can often complete in 2 weeks. Larger firms or those with complex setups should plan for 4 weeks.

### Will I lose any client data?

No. All client risk assessments, portfolio data, and historical information can be migrated from Nitrogen (Riskalyze). With proper export and import procedures, no data is lost.

### Do clients need to retake risk assessments?
