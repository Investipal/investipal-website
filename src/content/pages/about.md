Having worked as a Quant and ETF research analyst, our co-founder, Cameron Howe, was asked by friends and advisors alike: What should I invest in? While a simple question, it warrants a complex answer as everyone has unique constraints, interests, goals. Cameron recognized the need for a tool that empowers investors of all skill levels to confidently invest on their own. And from there, Investipal was born."
