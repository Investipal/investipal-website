## Pain and status quo

Prospects bounce when onboarding drags. Manual forms, PDF statement re-keying, and scattered tools slow time-to-value and kill momentum.

## Workflow with Investipal

- Digital intake captures risk and goals and flows into your proposal.
- Brokerage statement scanning turns PDFs into holdings instantly—no manual entry.
- Proposal generation assembles side-by-side comparisons and IPS/Reg BI docs.

## Proof

- 10–15 minutes from statement upload to proposal draft.
- Reduced errors vs. manual re-keying.
