    title: "Who We Are",
    content: "Our story started on the trading floor at an investment bank. Having worked as a Quant and ETF research analyst, our co-founder, Cameron Howe, was asked by friends and advisors alike: What should I invest in? While a simple question, it warrants a complex answer as everyone has unique constraints, interests, goals. Cameron recognized the need for a tool that empowers investors of all skill levels to confidently invest on their own. And from there, Investipal was born."

    details: "Our mission is to provide advisors with the support that enables advisors to unlock deeper levels of personalization with their clients. We're doing this by applying AI in areas best suited for it: portfolio management, onboarding and compliance - leaving you the time to grow your practice."
