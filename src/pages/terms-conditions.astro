              Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in securities, and other investments involve risk and are best made based on the advice of qualified financial professionals. Any investment in securities or other investments involves a risk of substantial losses. Before undertaking any investment program, you should consult a qualified financial professional. Please consider carefully whether such investment is suitable for you in light of your financial condition and ability to bear financial risks. Under no circumstances shall we be liable for any loss or damage you or anyone else incurs as a result of any investment or investment activity that you or anyone else engages in based on any information or material you receive through Investipal or our services.

              Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are mentioned below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular investment program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical investment does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical investment record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual investments. For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular investment program in spite of the investment losses are material points, which can also adversely affect investment results. There are numerous other factors related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific investment program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual investment results.
