# Value Propositions

## Segments
- Solo Advisors / Planners
- RIAs / Wealth Managers

## Solo Advisors — Outcome-first
- Reduce proposal turnaround from days to minutes → convert more prospects
- Eliminate manual statement entry → fewer errors, more client time
- Generate IPS/Reg BI alongside proposals → confidence and compliance

Proof anchors
- Demo on sample statements; step reduction vs. current process
- Minutes-to-proposal benchmarks; advisor-in-control review

## RIAs — Outcome-first
- Household-level onboarding and proposals in minutes → faster pipeline
- Embedded compliance artifacts → reduce remediation risk
- Fewer tools, less re-keying → lower ops drag and cost

Proof anchors
- Side-by-side portfolio comparisons; IPS/Reg BI readiness
- Time benchmarks and integration coverage

## Why Now & Why Better
- Status quo (spreadsheets + point tools) is slow, error-prone, and fragmented
- AI-first ingestion + embedded compliance unify intake→proposal→docs in one flow
