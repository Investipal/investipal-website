# Value Propositions

## Segments
- Solo Advisors / Planners
- RIAs / Wealth Managers

## Core Workflow (Product)
- Data intake (statements, risk tolerance) → analysis → proposal generation → compliance docs (IPS/Reg BI) → onboarding & account opening (e‑sign agreements)

## Solo Advisors — Outcome-first
- Reduce proposal turnaround from days to minutes → convert more prospects
- Eliminate manual statement entry → fewer errors, more client time
- Generate IPS/Reg BI alongside proposals → confidence and compliance
- Start narrow: statement scanning + proposals; expand to IPS/Reg BI when ready
- Accelerate onboarding & account opening with guided e‑sign flows

Proof anchors
- Demo on sample statements; step reduction vs. current process
- Minutes-to-proposal benchmarks; advisor-in-control review

## RIAs — Outcome-first
- Household-level onboarding and proposals in minutes → faster pipeline
- Embedded compliance artifacts → reduce remediation risk
- Fewer tools, less re-keying → lower ops drag and cost
- Held‑away assets workflows (aggregation, billing) integrated with proposals and compliance
- Streamlined onboarding & account opening across custodians; centralized agreement signing

Proof anchors
- Side-by-side portfolio comparisons; IPS/Reg BI readiness
- Time benchmarks and integration coverage

## Why Now & Why Better
- Status quo (spreadsheets + point tools) is slow, error-prone, and fragmented
- AI-first ingestion + embedded compliance unify intake→proposal→docs→onboarding in one flow
