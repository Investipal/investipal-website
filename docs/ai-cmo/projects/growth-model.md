# Growth Model

## Primary Loop
Founder-led distribution → Lifecycle email → Content/SEO → Demos → Wins
- KPIs: post→reply, reply→call, content→demo, demo→win

## Supporting Loop
Micro tools → Backlinks/Mentions → AEO inclusion → BOFU paid → Demos
- KPIs: referring domains, AEO mentions, retargeting CTR/CVR, CAC payback

## Sequencing
1) Message–market fit; LP proof; activation emails
2) Editorial pillars + distribution; use-case clusters; micro tool v1
3) AEO checklist; BOFU retargeting + competitor search

## Guardrails
- Maintain activation rate and time-to-first-success
- Track CAC payback and LTV/CAC; avoid broad TOFU spend early

## Cadence
- Weekly experiments; monthly channel deep dives; quarterly loop audit
