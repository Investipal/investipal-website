# Messaging Map

## Solo Advisors / Planners
- Who: Solo advisors managing $20–80M AUM
- Problem: Admin drag, manual statement entry, slow proposals
- Outcome: Minutes-to-proposal; IPS/Reg BI generated; more client time
- Proof: Demo on sample statements, time benchmarks, advisor-in-control
- Why-Better: One unified flow (intake→proposal→compliance) vs. fragmented tools

## RIAs / Wealth Managers
- Who: RIAs with 2–10 advisors
- Problem: Fragmented onboarding; re-keying; compliance bolted on
- Outcome: Household onboarding + proposals in minutes; embedded compliance
- Proof: Side-by-side comparisons; IPS/Reg BI readiness; integrations
- Why-Better: AI-first ingestion + explainable workflows; fewer tools, lower ops drag
