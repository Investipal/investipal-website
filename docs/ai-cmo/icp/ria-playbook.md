# ICP Playbook — RIAs / Wealth Managers

## Pains
- Manual onboarding, duplicate data entry, slow proposals
- Fragmented tools; compliance is bolted-on, not embedded
- Held-away assets and statements are painful to process

## Jobs-To-Be-Done
- Convert prospects faster with clear value proofs
- Build personalized portfolios with household-level context
- Produce IPS/Reg BI docs alongside proposals
- Streamline onboarding & account opening with guided e‑sign and custodian workflows

## Objections
- "We already have tools" → Gaps across intake → proposal → compliance
- "AI is a black box" → Explainable workflows, advisor-in-control review

## Triggers
- New household onboarding surge or RFP timeline
- Compliance remediation or audit prep
- Pursuing held-away assets consolidation

## Alternatives (Status Quo)
- Patchwork of intake, re-keying, proposal tools, and manual IPS/Reg BI
- Separate vendors per step; brittle integrations

## Dealbreakers
- Explainability and auditability; embedded disclosures
- Integration with core CRM/planning; SSO

## Proof & Social Proof Needs
- Time benchmarks (proposal in minutes)
- Side-by-side comparisons (current vs. proposed)
- Compliance readiness (IPS/Reg BI generated)

## CTAs
- Primary: Book a 15‑minute walkthrough
- Secondary: Download proposal/IPS checklist; Onboarding checklist
