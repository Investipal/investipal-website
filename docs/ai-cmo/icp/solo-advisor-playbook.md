# ICP Playbook — Solo Advisors / Planners

## Pains
- Admin tasks block growth; context switching across tools
- Manual statement entry and compliance docs

## Jobs-To-Be-Done
- Reclaim hours/week through automation
- Generate proposals and IPS quickly without extra staff

## Objections
- "I don’t have time to switch" → Start with statement scanning + proposals only
- "Too complex" → Guided workflow, minimal setup

## Triggers
- Prospect requests proposal/IPS this week
- Swamped by statement entry; backlog piling up
- Losing prospects to slow turnaround

## Alternatives (Status Quo)
- Manual spreadsheets + multiple point tools
- Outsourced admin with delays; vendor lock-in

## Dealbreakers
- Must be explainable; advisor-in-control
- Minimal setup; integrates with CRM/planning

## Proof & Social Proof Needs
- Demonstrate end-to-end on sample statements
- Show reduced steps vs. current process

## CTAs
- Primary: 3‑minute tour
- Secondary: Proposal template download
