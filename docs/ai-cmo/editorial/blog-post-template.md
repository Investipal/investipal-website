# Blog/Content Template — Demand Curve Style

Use this every time you draft. Fill the brackets, delete guidance before publish.

## Style & Tone
- Narrative-first intro: start with a realistic advisor scenario, then zoom out to the solution.
- Plain, precise language; avoid jargon unless defined in-line.
- Skimmable: short paragraphs (2–4 lines), bullets, descriptive subheads.
- Evidence-led: cite sources, show steps, include examples/templates.
- Voice: helpful, practitioner-led, confident but not salesy.

## Length Guidance
- Learn hubs: 1,500–2,500 words (deep coverage + FAQs + visuals)
- How-to/Guides: 1,000–1,800 words (step-by-step with screenshots)
- Updates/Announce: 700–1,200 words (concise, link to hubs)
- If competitor SERPs are thin, prioritize clarity over hitting max length.

## Metadata
- Target keyword: [primary query]
- Secondary queries: [list]
- Search intent: [informational/commercial/transactional/navigational]

## Opening (Problem → Promise)
