# Claims & Compliance Policy

Applies to all public content (site pages, blog, email, social, ads). Use with the Style Guide.

## Allowed claim types
- Workflow/time savings framed as ranges or examples (e.g., "minutes-to-proposal in typical cases"), not guarantees.
- Error reduction vs. manual re-keying stated qualitatively ("reduce typos"), or with sourced benchmarks.
- Process outcomes ("generate IPS alongside proposals") describing capabilities, not investment performance.
- Compliance positioning: "IPS/Reg BI documentation generation" (no legal advice).

## Disallowed
- Forward-looking performance or ROI guarantees (returns, alpha, tax outcomes).
- Absolute time/cost claims without context (e.g., "90% for everyone").
- Unqualified security/compliance assertions (e.g., "zero risk", "fully SEC-compliant").

## Required qualifiers
- Conditionals: "in typical workflows", "depending on data quality", "subject to advisor review".
- Human-in-the-loop: advisor reviews and finalizes proposals and IPS.
- Data provenance: statement OCR may require manual review for low-quality scans.

## Standard disclaimers
- Proposal/IPS: "Outputs are generated from client-provided data and require advisor review. This is not investment advice."
- Performance: "Past performance does not guarantee future results."
- Compliance: "Features assist documentation; they are not legal advice."

## Evidence & sourcing
- Prefer internal analytics, GA4/GSC, or customer-approved metrics.
- Market stats must include a public source link.

## Review workflow
- Brief → draft → compliance check → publish → periodic re-validation (quarterly for claims).
