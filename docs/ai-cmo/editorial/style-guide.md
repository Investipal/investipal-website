# Editorial Style Guide

## Tone & Voice
- Clear, confident, advisor-first; no hype
- Prefer plain language; define jargon once

## Claims
- Emphasize workflow/time savings; avoid performance promises
- Include assumptions and disclaimers where relevant

## Formatting
- Frontmatter for site content; scannable headings; short paragraphs
- Use internal links to relevant feature pages

## Reusable Blocks
- CTA: Book a 15â€‘minute demo
- Proof hooks: minutes-to-proposal, statement scanning, IPS/Reg BI embedded
