# Editorial Style Guide

## Tone & Voice
- Clear, confident, advisor-first; no hype
- Prefer plain language; define jargon once

## Claims
- Emphasize workflow/time savings; avoid performance promises
- Include assumptions and disclaimers where relevant

## Formatting
- Frontmatter for site content; scannable headings; short paragraphs
- Use internal links to relevant feature pages

## Reusable Blocks
- CTA: Book a 15‑minute demo
- Proof hooks: minutes-to-proposal, statement scanning, IPS/Reg BI embedded

## Lifecycle Email Tone & Structure
- Tone: helpful, concise, outcome-focused; invite replies early
- Structure: subject (benefit/outcome), 2–4 short lines, single CTA
- Flows:
  - Welcome: why now + 1 clear first-success action
  - Activation: objection handlers, nudges tied to events
  - Expansion: new use-cases; case studies; gentle asks
  - Win-back: acknowledge lapse; present easy re-entry path
