# Editorial Style Guide

## Narrative & Structure (Demand Curve-aligned)
- Open with a specific advisor scenario → establish stakes → promise the outcome.
- Keep intros <120 words; deliver the answer quickly, then expand.
- Use descriptive H2s that map to search sub-intents; add FAQs at the end.
- Prefer examples, screenshots, and templates over abstract descriptions.

## Length Targets
- Learn hubs: 1,500–2,500 words
- How-to guides: 1,000–1,800 words
- Announcements/updates: 700–1,200 words

## Readability
- Paragraphs 2–4 lines; sentence length 12–18 words on average.
- Bulleted lists for steps and checklists; bold key actions.
- Minimize fluff; cut filler adverbs; avoid passive voice.

## SEO Essentials
- One primary query; 3–6 secondary queries mapped to H2s.
- Include an answer box near the top; add FAQ schema where relevant.
- Internal links: hubs ↔ features ↔ downloads; external links to reputable sources.

## Demand Curve Alignment
- Make a strong, specific promise in the intro; deliver it fast.
- Use narrative hooks and concrete examples; minimize abstractions.
- Focus each piece on one core outcome; one primary CTA.
- Prefer evidence (benchmarks, screenshots) over claims.

## Search Intent & Alignment Checks
- Ensure TL;DR summary bullets near the top.
- Subhead cadence: new H2/H3 every 150–250 words.
- Link policy: ≥3 internal relevant links, ≥1 authoritative external citation where applicable.
- FAQs: 1–3 questions aligned to PAA.
- Compliance tone: educational; no clinical or regulated claims without citations.
## Tone & Voice
- Clear, confident, advisor-first; no hype
- Prefer plain language; define jargon once

## Claims
- Emphasize workflow/time savings; avoid performance promises
- Include assumptions and disclaimers where relevant

## Formatting
- Frontmatter for site content; scannable headings; short paragraphs
- Use internal links to relevant feature pages

## Reusable Blocks
- CTA: Book a 15‑minute demo
- Proof hooks: minutes-to-proposal, statement scanning, IPS/Reg BI embedded

## Lifecycle Email Tone & Structure
- Tone: helpful, concise, outcome-focused; invite replies early
- Structure: subject (benefit/outcome), 2–4 short lines, single CTA
- Flows:
  - Welcome: why now + 1 clear first-success action
  - Activation: objection handlers, nudges tied to events
  - Expansion: new use-cases; case studies; gentle asks
  - Win-back: acknowledge lapse; present easy re-entry path
