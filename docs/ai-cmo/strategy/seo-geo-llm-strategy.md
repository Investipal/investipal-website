# SEO / GEO / LLM Strategy — US

## Objectives
- Capture IPS demand (templates/examples) and convert via IPS Generator
- Support Statement Scanner with brokerage statement education and samples
- Add Proposal Generation and Onboarding to funnel (post‑analysis → conversion)
- Build compliance authority via Reg BI and IPS explainers

## Geo & Language
- Primary: United States (en)
- Local cues: US compliance terms (Reg BI, Form CRS), US custodians

## Content Plan (by cluster)
- IPS hub + downloads → feature demos
- Brokerage statements hub + annotated samples → scanner
- Proposal generation hub + templates → workflow demo
- Onboarding/account opening hub + checklist → solution page
- Reg BI explainers → generator
- RIA software category pages → solution pages (compliance, billing, reporting, PM)

## Technical SEO
- Schema: Article, HowTo, SoftwareApplication, FAQ
- Fast pages (Astro), internal linking from hubs to features, downloads
- Canonicals for templates/downloads; descriptive filenames

## LLM/AIO Readiness
- Provide concise answer sections atop learn pages
- Include structured FAQs matching PAA
- Offer downloadable artifacts (templates, checklists) and stepwise procedures
- Entities and relationships: IPS, Reg BI, brokerage statements, onboarding, proposals

## Demand Curve Alignment
- Narrative-first content with quick answers and clear outcomes
- Depth where needed (hubs), skimmable execution (how-tos), single CTA focus

## Measurement
- Cluster traffic, hub→feature CTR, template downloads, demo bookings
- Rank tracking for head + long-tail across clusters

## Roadmap (Q4–Q1)
1) IPS hub + templates; Scanner hub + samples
2) Reg BI hub + generator
3) Proposal generation hub + templates
4) Onboarding/account opening hub + checklist
5) RIA software category pages
