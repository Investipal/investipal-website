# Investipal Positioning

- **Audience**: RIAs, Wealth Managers, Solo Advisors
- **Problem**: Admin-heavy, fragmented workflows slow growth, increase errors, and delay proposals/compliance.
- **Solution**: Unified AI workflows for intake, brokerage statement scanning (OCR), proposal generation, IPS/Reg BI, and portfolio operations.
- **Outcomes**: Faster time-to-proposal (minutes), fewer errors from re-keying, integrated compliance, more advisor capacity for clients.
- **Differentiators**:
  - End-to-end workflow in one platform (not point tools)
  - AI-first data intake and analytics (PDF → structured portfolio)
  - Compliance embedded (IPS/Reg BI) with explainable outputs
  - Integrations with advisor CRMs and planning tools

## Core Messages
- Streamline onboarding and proposals from days to minutes.
- Eliminate manual statement entry; ingest any PDF into a clean, structured portfolio.
- Generate side-by-side portfolios and compliance docs together.
- Scale personalization without adding headcount.

## Proof Shape (non-promissory)
- Time saved per account (admin → value)
- Error reduction vs. manual re-keying
- Advisor capacity gained; faster prospect conversion

## Compliance Guardrails
- No forward-looking performance claims
- Emphasize workflow/time savings and error reduction
- Maintain disclosures/assumptions with each artifact

## Growth Model
- Primary loop: founder-led distribution → lifecycle email → content/SEO → demos
- Supporting loop: micro tools → backlinks/mentions → AEO inclusion → BOFU paid
- Loop KPIs: post→reply, reply→call, content→demo, demo→win; AEO inclusion rate

## Pricing Framework
- Tie value metric to outcomes (e.g., statements processed, appointments set, AUM pipeline influenced)
- Offer fast-track pilot or reverse trial to reduce adoption friction
- Keep packaging simple; highlight risk reversal on LP

## Experiment Protocol
- Weekly small tests; ICE/PIE scoring; owner + success metric; one variable per test
- Maintain a decision log; protect guardrails (activation rate, revenue, UX)

## KPI Tree
- Discovery: calls/week, response rate
- Activation: time-to-first-success, activation rate
- Growth: content→demo rate, CAC payback, LTV/CAC, AEO inclusion mentions

## Operating Cadence
- Weekly: experiment review, pipeline/content sync, creative matrix
- Monthly: channel deep dives, cost curve review, positioning refresh
- Quarterly: growth loop audit; re-validate ICP; prune underperformers
