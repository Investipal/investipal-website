# Investipal Positioning

- **Audience**: RIAs, Wealth Managers, Solo Advisors
- **Problem**: Admin-heavy, fragmented workflows slow growth, increase errors, and delay proposals/compliance.
- **Solution**: Unified AI workflows for intake, brokerage statement scanning (OCR), proposal generation, IPS/Reg BI, and portfolio operations.
- **Outcomes**: Faster time-to-proposal (minutes), fewer errors from re-keying, integrated compliance, more advisor capacity for clients.
- **Differentiators**:
  - End-to-end workflow in one platform (not point tools)
  - AI-first data intake and analytics (PDF → structured portfolio)
  - Compliance embedded (IPS/Reg BI) with explainable outputs
  - Integrations with advisor CRMs and planning tools

## Core Messages
- Streamline onboarding and proposals from days to minutes.
- Eliminate manual statement entry; ingest any PDF into a clean, structured portfolio.
- Generate side-by-side portfolios and compliance docs together.
- Scale personalization without adding headcount.

## Compliance Guardrails
