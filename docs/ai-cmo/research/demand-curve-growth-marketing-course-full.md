What Is Growth?
"A startup is a company designed to grow fast. ... The only essential thing is

growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth. ... You

have to know that growth is what you're after. The good news is, if you get growth,

everything else tends to fall into place. Which means you can use growth like a

compass to make almost every decision you face."

Paul Graham, investor, founder of Y Combinator
Growth is a widely used word, but it's often misunderstood.

Growth is an output.

It’s the Master Output that we measure using two important benchmarks: revenue and
customers.

Therefore, everything we'll cover in this program will be directly tied to these two
outputs.

Note: Profit is truly what matters in business. But, how your revenue translates into
profit is dependent on a lot of things that are outside the scope of this program. It should
go without saying, but the tech industry often forgets that you want to grow revenue
faster than you grow costs. That being said, we'll focus on revenue and customer
growth.

So, if revenue and customers are growth outputs, what are the inputs?

The inputs are the marketing tactics and strategies you will learn in this program.

Think of these tactics as levers that control a big machine. If you pull them in the wrong
order, the machine isn't going to do what you need it to do. But when you get them right,
you'll build a growth engine that consistently gets you more customers and increases
your revenue.

Throughout this program, you will learn what each lever does and which ones you
should pull.

For example, let's say you think your company should be running Facebook ads. Before
committing to that channel, you'll need to understand the inputs of that activity (money,
time, resources) and the desired outputs (more revenue and customers).

In future modules, we'll teach you exactly how to identify, prioritize, and execute these
growth marketing activities.

Once you understand the underlying mechanics of growth, you'll realize that there are
far fewer ways to grow a company than most people think. The strategies you'll learn in
this program will allow you to generate results regardless of your startup's industry,
country, or size.

The type of growth you will learn throughout this program is strategic, experimental, and
logical.

Growth is not about:

● Jumping from one tactic to another in search of a spike in traffic or revenue
● Spreading your limited resources thin across multiple strategies and channels
● Frantically rushing to a new strategy or channel because others are getting
results and you excited want to see if you can grow even faster by doing MORE.
Growth is not about being reactive.

Growth is about being proactive and putting your effort toward activities that are
proven to align with your business model, market, brand, and product.

Using growth frameworks like the Five Fits, Major Growth Lanes, and Growth Loops,
you'll learn how to grow your startup, regardless of your growth experience. We'll dive
into each of these in this program.

hy Growth Matters
There's a commonly held belief among founders that a poor product is the number one
cause of startup failure.

We've seen our fair share of companies that fall into that category. But there's another
reason that doesn't get as much attention.

Peter Thiel says it well:

“Most businesses actually get zero distribution channels to work. Poor distribution

— not product — is the number one cause of failure.”

Failory, a company that studies why businesses fail, reports the following:

Their study concluded: " Marketing mistakes were by far the most common [type], and
they were generally speaking the most deadly with 69% of all mentioned marketing
mistakes being fatal."

Marketing is often at the root of startup failures.

Our method puts the market first.

You aren't trying to find a market for your product; you're trying to build a product for a
specific market.

But another important framing makes it even more apparent how critical marketing is to
getting traction. When we read the studies above, it's easy to assume that the startup
did, in fact, get its product into the hands of the right market.

But what if the startup doesn't clearly understand their market in the first place? Or what
if they know their market but struggle to leverage marketing channels to reach the right
customers?

This program focuses on helping startups acquire customers and think more
strategically about growth. You'll write landing pages, design ads, launch
channels, etc. But more importantly, we'll help you approach your market in a
holistic, validated way.

Guiding Principles of How to Approach
Growth
So far, we’ve discussed what growth is and why it matters. Now, we’ll turn to a few key
principles to consider as you develop your growth strategy. These principles are
essential to remember because they’ll keep you focused on strategy, productive
learning, and achievement.

Here are the five principles we’ll cover:
1: Focus is key
2: Try fewer channels for more concentrated growth
3: Growth = learning
4: Leverage compounds
5: The staircase of growth

Focus is key
Summary: Focus on strategy. Not ad hoc attempts to grow.

We see too many teams spread themselves thin. They write tweets, draft email
newsletters, publish guest blog posts, etc., without knowing how these activities will lead
to customers and revenue.

To establish focus, we will help you identify and perform repeatable activities that
drive meaningful results for your revenue and customer base.

You won’t be able to find those meaningful growth activities without testing them, which
leads us to the next principle.

Try fewer channels for more concentrated growth
Summary: Focus on getting a few channels right to avoid getting a lot of

channels wrong.

We work with many founders who have adopted the mentality that they should always
be "doing more"—and doing more faster.

Especially when it comes to growth.

Startups that have hardly started marketing tell us about 10 different channels they'd
like to test. Or they ask us how to implement a sophisticated experimentation program,
so their team can start churning out at least 20 experiments a month.

Or, on the other side of the equation, they'll excitedly tell us how they found a channel
that's consistently and profitably generating new customers, only to immediately follow it
up with how they think they should start testing more channels to "diversify."

We understand where these founders are coming from. Intuitively, testing as many
things as possible makes sense to figure out what works. But this mentality has some
pitfalls.

Why “more” isn’t better in acquisition strategy
In the world of personal finance, we're taught that diversification is the name of the
game. ]

Why? Because you're trying to reduce risk by spreading your money across stocks,
instead of putting it all in a few stocks that you hope will take off. You're probably not in
a rush—retirement might be years later. So diversification serves a great purpose: It
reduces risk and increases security.

Contrast that with your typical startup. You don't have 30 years. You may have enough
capital only to last six months. This is an entirely different ballgame. You likely can't
survive on 10% annual growth rates. You need more significant growth, faster.

To do that, you must concentrate on only the channels that are most likely to
work for you. They’re the ones that will kick-start your growth.

It’s riskier to try too many channels at once than to pick the ones best suited for your
product, launch them, and evaluate their performance for continued optimization.

Let's look at the two extremes:

1. You run a massive company like Microsoft and Amazon

You have many billions in cash reserves, you stockpile more each year and can raise
money from the public market. You're trying to stay at the top of the game by
continuously investing in new technologies and opportunities.

If you miss out on the next big wave, you could die.

You take 0.01% of your resources to spin up multiple teams to tackle the same problem.
If one of them hits, it more than pays off. If it fails, it's no big deal.

2. You run an early-stage startup

It's you and maybe a handful of others. You have a few months of cash in the bank.

You're trying to stay alive and grow revenue so you can grow the team and cash
reserves.

You only have so many bets you can make before you get completely wiped out.

You need to aggressively prioritize the surest bets. If you find something that works, you
keep doing that.

Just like in poker, the house plays differently than someone with only a few chips
left. The latter needs to only play hands they know they can win.

Fewer channels means more concentrated investment,
too
Getting a single channel to work takes a lot of work (and often money).

You're competing with many other companies for the attention of your market. Many
companies have entire teams dedicated to one channel alone. To give yourself a
chance to succeed, you need to give a channel the time and attention it requires.

Here's what goes into launching a single channel, such as Facebook ads:

● Prepare for launch: You'll conduct research, design ad creatives, write copy, set
up your ad account, build your campaigns, set up pixels and conversion tracking,
create landing pages, and more.
● Launch: You'll likely be spending at least $2,000/month (and more if you want to
accelerate your learning). Plus, you'll be closely monitoring and optimizing
results. This takes time. And since you're new to this, there will be a learning
curve. Things often take longer than expected.
● Iterate: If your initial test looks promising, you'll invest more resources into
putting together new creatives and campaigns on an ongoing basis, as well as
continually analyzing results and optimizing. You may also want to increase your
spend to, say, $5,000 or $10,000/month.
Imagine if you tried to test four other channels at the same time. Each channel requires
its own research, ads, tracking, and so on. Plus, now your initial cost has increased 5x.
And once you launch, you'll have 5x as many channels to analyze, optimize, and
continue creating new assets for. This often leads to subpar results since your time and
budget are spread so thin. You can't give each channel the attention it requires.

Imagine testing all five at once and finding only one that works.

Great, right?

Possibly, but not if it took six months of slow, watered-down results to get there. Now,
you've burned through a good chunk of capital. You may not have enough in the bank to
begin investing heavily in and scaling up your winning channel.

Our intention isn't to scare you into thinking growth is impossible. But focus matters,
especially in the early stages of a company's life.

Let's move on from hypotheticals to how we'll help you apply this concept throughout
the program.

Acquisition channels

We will teach you our strategy and research framework, which will help you identify the
one or two channels with the greatest chance of success. This course will also guide
you in choosing the channels that are most likely to move the needle for your company.

This is a major shortcut. You won't need to test dozens of channels. You'll be able to
jump straight to the ones best suited for your company and goals.

Experiments & A/B tests

Early on, when you have limited resources, site traffic, users, and time, you have to be
exceptionally thoughtful and intentional with what you decide to test.

Why? Again, because we need big wins. Squeaking out 5% improvements isn't going to
cut it.

Here's a simple but powerful chart to illustrate the point:

hfront

Large companies have tons of traffic and can collect massive sample sizes. This allows
them to run lots of A/B tests that may only move the needle by a couple of percentage
points. But a 1% improvement is significant for a company like Google (which explains
their famous experiment in which they split-tested 40 different shades of blue on a
single toolbar).

It also allows them to be less thoughtful with what they test. If you can launch and
conclude a test in a single day, it makes sense to lower your bar.

Startups don't have this luxury. Whatever we prioritize, we need to have high conviction
that it will produce major results.

(We'll cover experiments in detail in later sections.)

Growth = learning
Summary: Apply all learnings—from successes and failures—to future

growth initiatives.

A good growth strategy emphasizes feedback loops. These allow you and your team to
quickly learn what’s working and what needs to be improved.

Growth is data-driven. You will learn how to apply the scientific method to your activities:
hypothesis, test parameters, observation, and analysis.

Most founders and startups struggle to learn from a failed experiment.

Let's look at some examples:

● You launch an ad campaign, but it yields few new signups.
● You launch a new feature, but it doesn’t improve your customer retention rate.
● You create content for a new channel, but hardly any sales come through.
You've learned nothing if you can't understand WHY each failed and HOW to ensure
that it doesn't fail again.

The opposite can also be said: If something is working, but you have no idea why or
how to continue growing it, you don't really have a strategy.

You got lucky.

You'll learn how to create a growth strategy that includes systematic experiments. Being
systematic will help you know whether or not your experiments are worth continuing.

You'll also learn how to prioritize which activities to focus on. You'll find out how to
collect the right information to know when it’s time to double down or move on to the
next experiment.

Leverage compounds over time
Summary: Focus on high-leverage activities for compounded growth.

How do startups with only a few people experience explosive growth and win out
against established industry players that are hundreds of times bigger?

They apply an extreme amount of force to a single point of leverage. Leverage is
what allows tiny companies to create massive change.

Leverage compounds, meaning that the high-leverage activities you do today will allow
you to do more with fewer resources in the future. As you learned in the last principle
(growth = learning), those learning fast generate compounding effects earlier.

Therefore, to create maximum leverage, you'll want to learn as fast as possible in the
beginning to turn that knowledge into growth and growth into leverage.

Our program focuses on only high-leverage activities.

We know your time is valuable, so our program focuses on HOW to execute
high-leverage activities.

Soon, you'll have a growth strategy that will keep you laser-focused on the opportunities
with the highest likelihood of producing meaningful results.

The staircase of growth
Summary: Continuously optimize your business model for your channel.

Growth often occurs in a step function, like stairs going upward. Here's how it works:

● You'll get a growth activity to work well. You'll acquire new customers
consistently, and your revenue will steadily increase.
● Then, for seemingly no reason in particular, growth will begin to slow. You'll see
all your growth outputs plateau.
This tends to occur when you reach the upper ceiling of a channel, market, or
tactic—you've reached all the customers a single channel can reach. This is a sign that
you're ready to take a step up the staircase to the next level of growth.

For example, let's say you're selling a pool toy, and you start by selling door-to-door in
your hometown. You know there are 10,000 pools within your town. The ceiling of
selling using door-to-door as your growth channel is about 10,000 sales. Once you
reach that point, you'll have to find another way to reach pool owners.

(You'll learn about conducting market research and the specifics of each growth channel
in later modules, so don't worry about the details of this example.)

Let's fast-forward

You've begun selling your pool toy through Facebook ads. You've now sold over
100,000 units, and things seem to be going well. But then you hit a plateau again.

Was it because of a market ceiling? Considering that over two billion people are on
Facebook and over 10.4 million residential swimming pools in the US alone, it's highly
unlikely that you've hit a ceiling.

What's more probable is that you've hit the point of diminishing returns.

We'll explain this concept in more detail when you learn how to scale a working growth
channel. But essentially, it means that you will need to optimize your business model to
match the channel you're selling through.

In future modules, we'll share ways to identify whether you will need to find a new
strategy and how to pivot when the time comes.

Common Growth Myths and
Misconceptions
Before moving on to your first Growth Program project, we want to take a moment to
debunk a few common myths about growth marketing.

Giving any credence to the following myths could undermine all your growth efforts, so
it’s important to acknowledge them for what they are: unfounded theories.

By rejecting the following myths, we’re really reaffirming an actual growth marketing
truth: Real, lasting growth takes strategy, not luck.

Growth hacking
Around 2010, a term started to circulate in the startup and marketing worlds: growth
hacking.

"Growth hacking" was the tenacious pursuit of business growth, applying a systematic
approach that looked well beyond traditional marketing methods and into product
development.

For example, Airbnb used growth hacking to register its first users —while
validating that it was building something people wanted.

How? They made it extremely easy to post an Airbnb listing to Craigslist through a
custom integration. If that sounds like an engineering/product project rather than a
marketing one, that’s because it was.

That’s all well and good. But the problem is that the word hacking has taken on multiple
meanings that can create confusion. We believe it leads people to think there's a single
tactic that can 100x your growth overnight, and it's your job as a marketer to find it.

That's a myth.

We think this is worth clarifying because "tactic hunting" contradicts our first guiding
principle of growth: Focus wins.

Bouncing from hack to hack without establishing repeatable and sustainable practices
isn't an effective or enjoyable way to run a business.

Note: Growth hacks only work if the product solves a painful problem for a

specific customer who is motivated to pay to solve it. Airbnb was already at

that stage. So, their clever hack scaled their in-demand product faster.

We don't refer to our work as growth hacking or ourselves as growth hackers. Beware of
those who try to sell you on the idea that a single hack can turn your business into an
overnight success. Anyone promising a way of getting significant growth quickly will
likely get rich off YOU.

Instead, we'll teach you how to test ideas quickly, but we'll also set realistic expectations
about what kind of growth to expect and how long it will take.

This brings us to our next misconception: chasing silver bullets.

The silver bullet fallacy
A "silver bullet" is a metaphor for a single activity that will guarantee victory. Like growth
hacking, the silver bullet fallacy is the idea that a single marketing activity or channel will
automatically lead to exponential growth.

After running thousands of experiments on every single channel and working with over
a thousand startups, we can confidently say that we have yet to see a single example of
a silver bullet.

Growth is hard. Yes, that's a scary statement.

But because growth is hard, you'll gain a competitive advantage when you get it right.

Startups chasing silver bullets might get short-term wins, but growth will likely stop
there. They'll lose in the long run unless they take a more thoughtful and strategic
approach.

Therein lies your opportunity: If you can grow purposefully from the start, then you'll hold
a competitive advantage.

A solid growth engine doubles as a barrier preventing your competition from stealing
your customers.

Why startups struggle to grow
We've covered why marketing is critical to a startup's success. But the concept of
marketing or customer acquisition isn't a secret.

So why do marketing problems remain a primary reason for startup failure?

We have a few possible explanations:

Bootstrapped startups can't afford top marketing talent. The best agencies,
consultants, and full-time marketers can easily cost $10-15k/month. If hiring isn't
an option, founders must learn marketing themselves. It can be done. But it's
often a long and risky process. It can take months (if not longer) to sift through
the countless articles, blogs, and guides to determine what's high-quality AND
relevant to your business. Then there's the issue that even some of the best
materials fail to teach you exactly how to execute. They may be useful for
pointing you in the right direction, but rarely will you find resources that take you
all the way through strategy and step-by-step implementation.
It's hard to know what true marketing talent looks like. It's not just
bootstrapped startups that struggle. Even well-funded companies that can afford
top talent often struggle to scale their customer acquisition. How is that possible?
One consistent pattern we've seen is companies lacking the internal expertise to
identify good marketing talent. The truth is that just because an agency or
consultant is expensive doesn't mean they actually know what they're doing. It
takes having at least some growth knowledge to vet growth talent effectively.
Top-tier marketing talent is hard to come by. And finally, regardless of funding
or expertise, it's hard to hire top talent because they're in high demand (and they
know it). They're either making big-time salaries at later-stage companies or
they're running their businesses.
None of this is meant to scare you into thinking all is doomed. Amazing agencies and
full-time hires are out there (and we can help you find them). But we feel it's important to
explain all of this because:

It shows how important it is for founders/startup teams to develop in-house
expertise.
It explains exactly why we built this program.

marketing efforts. 😉

Glossary: Learn Marketing Terms
The goal of this page is to explain marketing jargon simply and quickly. It will help you
understand things faster and easier than if you had to Google everything. Plus, Google
results can be too jargon-heavy.

Use command + F (Ctrl + F) to find the words faster. Seriously. Don’t scroll through this
page. Search through it.

Let’s roll.

“Above the fold” and “below the fold”
Traditionally “above the fold” comes from newspapers. It is the upper half of the front
page of a newspaper or tabloid where an important news story or photograph is often
located.

In the context of websites, it’s the content shown on a visitor’s screen when they first hit
the website. The “fold” being the bottom of their view screen at that point. And thus,
“below the fold” is all content that is below that point that is not visible when the visitor
first hits the page.

Where the “fold” lies depends on the visitor’s device. A 34” monitor, a laptop, an iPad, or
an iPhone SE all have very different screen sizes, so the fold would be completely
different places.

Generally, the content “above the fold” should tell the majority of visitors what your
product is and why it’s useful. They shouldn’t have to scroll to find that out.

B2C
Stands for business-to-consumer. Means you’re selling to people, not businesses or
governments.

Products that are B2C

● Toothbrushes
● Grocery Stores
● Netflix
Products that are NOT B2C

● Steel Mills
● Accounting software
● Forklifts
B2B
Stands for business-to-business. Means you’re selling to business, not people or
governments. These tend to sound "boring”, but they can be anything but.

Products that are B2B

● Steel Mills
● Accounting software
● Forklifts
B2G
Stands for business-to-government. Means you’re selling to governments, not people or
businesses.

These are even more boring than B2B businesses. And often great businesses to be in.

There is often overlap with B2B.

Products that are B2G

● Voting software
● Plumber agencies
● Fertilizer (the government has to water its lawns, too!)
Acceptable CAC (Cost of Acquiring a
Customer)
How much you can afford to pay... to get someone to pay you.

Examples

● You’re an accountant. You pay anyone who refers you a new client $300. Your
CAC is $300.
● You sell furniture. You pay $100 for a classified ad in the newspaper. You sell two
couches through it. Your CAC is $50.
More complicated example:

● You pay a salesperson $10,000 a month to send out emails for you. Plus a
$1,000 bonus for each customer they bring in. You close 5 deals a month.
● Total cost: $10,000 + $1,000*5 = $15,
● Number of deals: 5
● Cost divided by deals: $3,
● Your CAC is $3,000.
The higher the CAC you can afford, the more options you have to acquire customers.

For example:

● If you sell a $10 product and can only afford to spend $2 per sale, then your
options are pretty limited to free and cheap options, such as content marketing.
● If you sell a $1M software subscription, you can afford a lot in ads, conferences,
content, and sales people.
The downsides of a high CAC are:

● The more you need to spend to test a channel. If you can afford $10k per
customer, you must spend multiple 5 or 6 figures to test a channel.
● It typically takes much longer to sell the product, so it takes longer to test a
channel. For example, if it takes a lead 3 months to turn into a customer, any
change you make might take 3+ months to see if it worked.
So, how much can you afford?

How do you figure out what your acceptable CAC is? A few approaches.

Approach 1: Use a rule of thumb

If you don’t want to think much about it, take your LTV and divide it by 3. This tends to
be the case for most companies.

Approach 2: Back into CAC from your LTV

Start with your LTV (also explained in this doc)

Subtract out all the variable costs per purchase.

What are variable costs? They’re how much you have to pay to make the product.

Examples:

● You sell couches. It costs you $40 dollars to build a couch and $10 to wrap it in
plastic. Your variable cost is $50.
● You AirBnB out your house. Each time someone rents it, you have to pay a
cleaner $100 to fix it up. Plus you have to pay $3 for laundry detergent, dish
soap, and the electricity they used. Your variable cost is $103.
Subtract out how the minimum profit you need to be left over.
Now: gut check this number. Would you actually be comfortable paying that much,
today, for a new customer? Think about what hidden costs pop up and account for
those. Give yourself a bunch of room for error.

Let’s use the couch example. Let’s say you sell couches for $500.

LTV = $
$500 - $50 per couch = $450 per couch.
I need to make $100 per couch or my family can’t make rent.
Acceptable CAC: $450-100 = $350.
Gut check: I also pay employees and rent office space. That adds up to $50 per
couch.
Acceptable CAC is actually $300.
Approach 3: Use budget and user targets

This approach is meant for companies that haven’t figured out how to charge yet, but
need more users.

Figure out how much budget you have to spend.
Sometimes this number is zero. That’s OK.
Figure out how many users you need, minimum.
Divide #1 by #
One last note on CAC. The more viral your product is — meaning, the more people tell
other people about it — the cheaper your CAC gets. Let’s use an example.

Let’s take Dropbox as an example. Ordinarily, let’s say Dropbox has a CAC of $
through ads; they have to spend $500 to get a new customer. But, on average, a new
Dropbox user refers 9 friends (at almost no extra cost to Dropbox).

Dropbox’s actual CAC would be $50, because they get 10 customers for $500.

CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
How much it costs to acquire ("get") a user — meaning they're using your product.

This depends on what type of product you have.

If you're accounting software, your CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) is probably your Cost Per
Signup. If you're a mobile app, it's probably your Cost Per Install. If you're an
eCommerce company, it might be your Cost Per Purchase.

You can even have multiple different CPAs you're tracking for the same product. An
"acquisition" is whatever you want to define it to be (a signup, an install, etc.).

The important thing is to be on the same page with your team about what "CPA" means
for you.

CPA is different from CPC, which is always the cost per ad click. It's also different from
CAC, which is always the cost per purchase.

CPC (Cost Per Click)
How much you have to pay for each person who clicks on your ad.

For example, if 10 people click on your Facebook ads and you’ve spent $50 on
Facebook ads, your CPC is $5.

CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization)
The use of analytics and user feedback to improve the performance of your website for
conversions.

CRO is typically associated with acquiring new customers, registrations, and
downloads, but it can be used to improve any metric important to your business.

Examples

● You look at your data and realize your mobile site looks horrible - keeping many
people from signing up. You make your landing page mobile-friendly.
● You put a live chat widget on your site.
● You send Task Rabbits into offices to demo a high-end bike in person - so people
can see it and feel it before they buy.
CRO is far reaching and includes everything from A/B testing, user surveys, checkout
flow changes, to minor tweaks in copy and creatives.

LTV (Lifetime Value)
How much you expect your customers to pay you, total. Over their whole time with your
company.

Examples

● If someone pays you $100 per month but will usually stay with you for 2 years,
your LTV is $2400 (24 months * $100 per month).
● If they buy once and paying $200, your LTV is $200.
● If they pay $500 up front, then $100 every year, and customers stay with you for
6 years on average, your LTV is $1100.
Early companies won’t always have a good idea of what their LTV is, because they
don’t know how long customers stay with them.

In general, keep this number conservative (low).

Alternative: LTV based on churn
Another way to calculate LTV is by looking at the percentage of people who leave you
every month. For example, if you cost $50 a month, and 1/6 of your customers cancel
their subscription every month, your LTV would be 6*$50...or $300. Because your
average customer stays 6 months.

That 1/6 is also called your churn rate. So, more generally, LTV would be monthly
revenue ($50) divided by churn (1/6, or 16%).

Alternative: LTV based on margins
It’s sometimes useful to say your LTV is the lifetime profit you make from a customer,
not just how much they pay you.

For example, if you’re a hamburger joint and customers pay you $10 per hamburger, but
you pay $3 per hamburger, you might want to treat $7 as your LTV — since you know
you have to pay for a hamburger, no matter what.

This is usually the case for eCommerce companies shipping physical goods they have
to pay for themselves.

Software businesses (such as SaaS businesses), generally don’t have to pay for
anything when they get a new customer. So they can base their LTV on revenue and
not margins.

Ads that expose you to a business for the first time.

For example, if you've never seen Fictitious Dog Food and then see a Pinterest ad for it,
well, then you have heard of Fictitious Dog Food now.

Retargeting Ads
Ads you see after you're already aware of someone's business.

For example, after you went to Bell Curve's website (former name of Demand Curve),
we showed you a retargeting ad on Facebook and Instagram. It looked like this:

SaaS
Stands for “Software as a Service”. When you pay monthly (or quarterly, yearly, etc.) to
use a website or app. Forever.

In the past, companies used to sell you software (like Photoshop or Microsoft Word)
once. Then you could use it forever.

Now, companies charge you monthly to use the same software. That’s SaaS.

Examples

● Netflix is SaaS.
● Office 365 is SaaS.
● Adobe Creative Cloud is SaaS.
Not SaaS

● Uber (no monthly fee; you pay per ride)
● The latest version of the Madden NFL video game series. (You pay per game)
● Food trucks (pay per meal)
Service-based businesses
Businesses where the major cost is salaries and actual people working. Not physical
materials.

Examples

● A law firm. Major expenses are lawyers, paralegals, and unwitting law school
interns.
● A plumbing company. Major expenses are plumber salaries, not the tools.
● A high school. Major expenses are teacher salaries.
● A barbershop. Major expenses are barber salaries.
Not service-based businesses

● A towel company. Major expenses are unfinished cotton and dyes.
● Facebook. It doesn’t need a ton of employees to serve ads to over a billion
people. Major expenses, if any, are computer servers.
● Allbirds. Major expenses are shoe materials.
Ecommerce
Selling physical products online.

Technically, ecommerce is selling anything online, but that's not what actually refer to it
as.

Instead, ecommerce is basically selling physical products online, often direct to
consumer.

Examples of ecommerce

● Selling your used guitar on eBay
● Casper mattresses
● Buying a book on Amazon
Not ecommerce

● Netflix (not a physical thing)
● A spa day
● A premium LinkedIn subscription
● A lawyer
Landing Page
The first page users see when they hit your site, usually after clicking an ad. People
“land” on it like a plane touching down on pavement. Instead of coming from a plane,
they come from your ad.

A landing page is very close to a homepage, which is what lives at the base address for
your site (airbnb.com). Landing pages can be “after the slash”
(airbnb.com/san-francisco).

● AirBnB’s San Francisco landing page
● AirBnB’s homepage
The difference between a landing page and a homepage is that you can make different
landing pages for different ads. For example, if you’re running an ad in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, you might use photos from Milwaukee on your ad landing page. But your
homepage would have images from around the world.

ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
Similar to LTV, but ARPU is based on a specific timeframe. Companies primarily talk
about their ARPU on a monthly or annual basis.

To calculate your ARPU for any given month, take your total revenue for the month and
divide it by your total number of active customers during that same month.

For software products with free and paying users, be sure to use only your paying
customers when calculating ARPU.

Introduction: Growth Fundamentals
In the last module, Growth Principles, we defined growth and discussed why it’s
important. In this section, we'll introduce frameworks and concepts that explain how
companies grow.

After this module, you'll have the same frameworks that the most elite growth marketers
use to grow some of the biggest businesses in the world systematically.

Once you understand these fundamental frameworks, you'll be able to look at your
startup through a new lens: a lens of growth. This will allow you to make seemingly
challenging decisions in a structured and informed way.

The fundamentals we'll cover are the core of this program and apply to all business
models.

By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

● The Five Fits Framework: how five core components of your company will determine your
ability to grow rapidly and consistently
● The Growth Funnel: the path your customers take from knowing nothing about your
business to buying from you
● Acquisition Loops: a framework for understanding why certain channels produce
exponential growth while others result in only linear or inconsistent results
● Growth Process: a simple system for ensuring that every action you take is done
purposefully, with the goal of gaining knowledge to drive growth forward
After reading this module, you'll understand critical frameworks that explain what
separates the fastest-growing companies from the rest. And more importantly, you'll be
able to apply those concepts to your startup.

Let's dive in.

The Five Fits Framework
Growth isn't just about marketing channels, conversion rate optimization, or any other
stand-alone function. Growth is holistic—it comes when the individual parts of your
startup are working together, in harmony.

This is easier said than done. That's why we use something called the Five Fits
Framework to map exactly how the different components of a company "fit" together to
drive (or hinder) growth.

Founders are often floored by how powerful this framework is for decision making. The
Five Fits Framework allows you to:

● Figure out how your startup will grow.
● Skip months or years of trial and error by investing in the right strategy early on.
● Reverse-engineer how competitors and other companies grow (and see why some are able
to grow and others aren't).
● Identify when, why, and if you should make a change within your startup, and how to run
experiments with purpose.
Your foundational fits will set you up for success or failure down the road.

It won't matter how hard you work or how clever your tactics are. If your fits are
broken, growth will be incredibly hard.

What is the Five Fits Framework?
You've probably heard of the concept of "product-market fit": when your product aligns
with the needs of a market. You may even be familiar with the concept of
"channel-product fit": when the channel you use to acquire customers works well with
the product you're selling. These are two examples of "fits."

The team at ed-tech company Reforge took these concepts a step further by explaining
that there are four fits that determine the growth potential of a product. We've built on
their framework and added a fifth component (brand). Here are all five:

Your market: whom you choose to serve
Your product: what you sell
Your business model: how you make money
Your brand: how you present yourself to your market and the world
Your acquisition channel: how you get new customers
Each component has a direct relationship with the others.

For example, you might have the best product, wealthiest market, most attractive brand,
and highest-margin business model. But if you can't figure out a way to consistently and
repeatedly acquire new customers, your startup will likely fail.

We use the term "fit" to describe the relationship between each of the five key
components.

Let's take a look at how the five fits work together.

In the rest of this article, we’ll go through how market relates to each of the other four
components. We’ll look at how market fits with product (Market-Product Fit), model
(Market-Model Fit), brand (Market-Brand Fit), and channel (Market-Channel Fit). We’ll
then consider the relationships between product and channel (Product-Channel Fit) and
model and channel (Model-Channel Fit). Each fit relationship is a testament to just how
intertwined marketing is with every other element of your business and its ecosystem.
Any fit that’s not a strong one reduces the chances of growth and success.

Market-product fit
Definition: how your market fits with the product you sell

Looking back at Failory's report on why startups fail, we see that the most common
reason is a lack of product-market fit (34%).

Note: Product-market fit and market-product fit are interchangeable. While it's just

a matter of wording, we prefer the latter because it serves as a reminder that

when building a product, everything starts with the market. Not the other way

around.

Founders often prioritize creating a product over choosing a market that's in need of a
solution. That's a mistake we've seen thousands of times.

● Startups build a product they think is wonderful.
● They never find a market that has a need for it.
Even well-funded startups can crash if they don't consider the market they're selling to
before building a product.

Take Quibi, for example. The mobile-only streaming service raised nearly $2 billion (yes,
with a B ) but shut down only seven months after launch.

One of the primary reasons for this meteoric failure was a lack of market-product fit. The
target market—people with smartphones who watch content—was massive, and yet
Quibi was only able to acquire about 72,000 paying customers.

Why? Because the problem they were looking to solve wasn't severe enough for users
to switch to Quibi from YouTube or TikTok, where they could watch videos for free.

Conversely, the media startup Patreon was able to build a product that their target
market—YouTubers who need to find ways to monetize their content—found valuable
from day one. Patreon's founders were creators themselves. They intimately understood
the problem they were trying to solve and whom they were solving it for. These market
insights were based on feedback from real users and the market—not assumptions.

Patreon started with the market. They didn't build a product and then start searching for
customers.

Market-model fit
Definition: how your market fits with your product’s business model

Your market will also dictate your pricing and business model, and vice versa.

There are two major business-model factors we like to focus on:

How much you charge: What is the lifetime value or average revenue per year
each customer generates?
How and when you charge: Do you charge a monthly subscription? Do charge
a one-time, upfront payment? Or do you offer a free trial or freemium option?
Then there are a few key market-model factors:

Market size: How many potential buyers are in your market?
Buying power: How much is an individual within your market able to spend?
Willingness to pay: How motivated are they to spend?
Inevitably, your business model will cause friction between your business and your
customers. Your goal is to minimize that friction.

How much you charge & market size

First, we need to look at the relationship between how much you charge and the size of
your market. If your goal is to build a massive company, you're unlikely to succeed if
you're targeting a small market and charging a small amount.

This diagram from founder and investor Christoph Janz demonstrates our point. There's
a tradeoff between the number of customers you need to acquire and the price you're
able to charge.

If you have a small market size AND low average annual revenue per customer, that's a
market-model fit issue (especially if your goal is to build a large company). This seems
like an obvious concept, but it's something startups often get wrong. That's likely
because they think their market is bigger than it really is, and/or they think they'll be able
to charge more than they really can.

Buying power & willingness to pay

Another critical concept: The relationship between your market's buying
power/willingness to pay and how much you charge. Your market may desperately want
your product, but if they simply don't have the budget, then nothing else matters. You
must adapt your model for your market's buying power.

On the flip side, you may be targeting a market with deep pockets, but it's their
willingness to pay that will determine how much you can actually charge. How much do
they need and value your product?

How and when you charge

Finally, how you charge your customers is important. Some products are totally free to
use (Twitter); others offer a freemium plan (Grammarly and Spotify); some offer monthly
or annual subscriptions (Netflix); and some require big one-time payments (buying a
car). Each model has its own level of friction.

The lower the buying power and willingness to pay, the more friction you'll create by
requiring big, upfront payments. You'd likely find more success by lowering your prices,
while simultaneously using a low-friction model like freemium or subscription.

Alternatively, if your market does have high buying power and willingness to pay, you
can employ a higher-friction model, such as six-figure annual contracts or big one-time
payments.

Market-brand fit
Definition: how your market fits with your product’s brand

A "market" is a group of individuals who have certain commonalities.

A strong brand appeals to those commonalities.

We define "brand" as how you communicate with your market. This includes
colors, typography, design style, imagery, and the language you use.

Sure, you make the creative decisions. But your brand is ultimately your market's
perception of your startup. What do your brand elements, and your brand as a whole,
make people think—and feel?

Those kinds of connotations can be extremely powerful. Think about your own favorite
brand. Why do you like it? Chances are, the number one reason is that you love the
product. But right below that, you may realize how much you love the brand. And maybe
the brand is what made you want to use the product in the first place. Maybe you felt a
special connection with it because of how it looked and sounded.

(This thought exercise applies to music too. Sure, you might love Beyoncé’s music [her

product] but for most people, it’s who she is and what she stands for [her brand] that
lead to Beyhive membership. Her market loves her brand.)

Example of market-brand fit: Betterment

Let's look at how Betterment, an investing and savings app, was able to find
market-brand fit. We'll focus on the language they use in their communications and
marketing.

Betterment had to overcome a key emotional hurdle: People are intimidated by personal
finance. They're skeptical of companies trying to manage their money.

So they were intentional in how they crafted their messaging. They kept it professional
and friendly, using approachable language like "meet the app" and "inspiration."

If Betterment's brand were silly, unprofessional, or unfocused, they'd have a hard time
winning the trust of their market.

Brand and other fits

Your brand needs to align with your market. But it's also critical that your brand align
with the other three components:

● Brand-model fit: E.g., Mercedes-Benz is a premium brand. They don't sell cars for $15k. If
your brand is highly exclusive, your business model shouldn't diminish that exclusive nature.
● Brand-product: Your product experience is an extension of your brand. How your product
looks and works influences your brand perception.
● Brand-channel: Your brand could determine how you approach certain channels, and it
could even help you rule out channels. If you operate in a very serious industry like
cybersecurity, you might want to avoid informal channels like TikTok or Snapchat. If your
brand is family-oriented, there are many "adult" placements you wouldn't want your brand
seen on. And if your brand is all about sustainability, you might rule out resource-intensive
channels like direct mail.
As you can see, brand touches every aspect of your business. We recommend starting
with finding market-brand fit, then allowing your learnings to shape how you approach
the other brand fits.

Market-channel fit
Definition: how your market fits with your customer acquisition channels

Your market will influence which channels you pursue.

As we discussed in the market-brand fit section, your market will have expectations
depending on the industry and product category.

If you're selling payroll software to municipalities with over a million citizens, you have a
very small market to sell to: the purchasing department and financiers of select cities. It
would make little sense, from a communications standpoint, to try to reach those people
using Snapchat ads.

Why? Two main reasons:

The channel isn't targeted enough : Snapchat will allow you to target your ads
to specific locations, but it won't allow you to target the specific employees of a
city. This means that if you run Snapchat ads, most viewers will fall outside your
target market.
The channel context doesn't align: It's possible that your target market has
Snapchat, but that's definitely not the channel they expect (or want) to see
work-related content on. Seeing an ad for payroll software on a non-business
app might make them hesitate to trust your brand with something as serious as
payroll.
Just because a channel exists doesn't mean you need to use it. That's why it's so
important to truly understand your market. Deep customer research will uncover key
insights such as where potential customers spend time offline and online, how they

purchase products like yours, their buying intent on various channels, and other
channel-related clues.

Having these insights allows you to identify optimal channels, cut the rest, and hone
your messaging to each specific channel. We'll show you exactly how to do that in later
modules.

Product-channel fit
Definition: how your product fits with your customer acquisition channels

The product you sell must also align with the channel you sell it through.

Let's continue our payroll software example from the last section. Because your market
is small, you'll need to charge a lot for your product to generate revenue and grow. In
order to charge a lot, your product must be robust. Your sales cycle will be pretty
complex, as the buyer is going to need to make sure your product is perfect for them
before signing off on a large purchase.

Because the product is expensive and the sales cycle is complex, you'll need to choose
an acquisition channel that allows you to communicate product information effectively
with your target market.

In this example, a channel like Facebook ads wouldn't allow you to convince your buyer
to make a large purchase. Users are scrolling too quickly and absorbing too little
information for such a complex product. Direct sales would probably make the most
sense.

As a rule of thumb: The more complex your product, the more direct and hands-on
your acquisition channel needs to be.

The other important thing to consider as you find your product-channel fit is that
channels are usually out of your direct control. Google's SEO algorithm changes, and
the price of ads fluctuates.

What is in your control is your product. So it's smart to build your product for the specific
channel(s) you want to leverage. Since channels aren't in your control, you must be able
to adjust your product over time to work with your chosen growth channels.

Model-channel fit
Definition: how your business model fits with your customer acquisition

channels

Your business model will limit the acquisition channels that are worth testing.

Let's say you charge $100,000 up front for your product. That's a lot of money, and it will
require extensive communication with a prospective customer to close the deal. Your
customer isn't going to feel comfortable paying you $100,000 after seeing a few ads and
reading the FAQs page on your site. You need a more context-rich channel, like sales.

Luckily, with such a high contract value, you'll be able to afford such an expensive
channel. Your model-channel fit will be strong.

Here're a couple of other rules to consider:

● The more expensive your product, the more direct and hands-on your acquisition
channel needs to be. You’ll likely need multiple touchpoints to communicate the value of
your product and get customers over the high price point.
● The more friction there is in your product, the more hands-on your channel needs to
be. Low-cost channels like virality can work for free products because there’s virtually no
friction—there’s no cost to use the product. Complex, high-friction products—like most B2B
tools—will require higher-touch, context-rich channels like content and sales.
You should also pay attention to the unit economics when considering your
model-channel fit. The cost of acquiring a customer will vary drastically based on your
channel:

● Product virality has a very low cost.
● Content marketing is typically next in line.
● Paid marketing comes next.
● Then sales.
Note: Sales can be broken down into two sub-categories: inbound sales and

outbound sales. With inbound, you pair sales with a second channel

lane—usually content or paid marketing. The secondary channel produces your

lead gen while your inbound sales team turns those leads into customers.

Outbound sales relies on your sales team to produce both lead gen and the

conversion of those leads. On our cost spectrum, inbound sales is generally

lower-cost than outbound.

To drive growth profitably at scale, you must have a business model that produces
significantly more revenue than the cost of your channel.

For example, an ecommerce store whose average customer spends only $30/year will
struggle to afford to acquire customers through ads. It will likely cost more than $30 to
acquire each new customer. Similarly, a B2B company with an average customer value
of $500 will struggle to make outbound sales work. Since sales labor isn't cheap, it
usually costs more than $500 to close a B2B sale.

The five fits summary
There's no such thing as a "perfect fit." It's not fixed, and it's not something you ever
"finish." Markets are always changing, products come and go, and channels are
constantly in flux.

Our job as startup and growth leaders is to design foundations using these fits as our
guiding light and then consistently optimize the fits as we experiment and learn.

We put a lot of emphasis on the five fits because they set the stage for what really
matters when it comes to growth. Far too many people get caught up in channel
strategy, tactics, and A/B testing. None of this matters if your foundation is broken. And
yet, all those things will be significantly more effective if your foundation is strong.

This framework is a shortcut for figuring out which marketing channels you should
pursue. When you're just starting to think about customer acquisition, there are
seemingly endless channels and tactics to consider. But once you start thinking about
your strategy through the lens of the five fits, it becomes clear that there are actually
very few ways to approach customer acquisition—and you'll be able to confidently
ignore the rest.

The Growth Funnel and Acquisition Loops
The Five Fits Framework helps us to visualize WHY certain startups grow, but it doesn't
explain HOW they do it. For that, we'll introduce two new frameworks:

● The Growth Funnel
● Acquisition Loops
The Growth Funnel
A typical growth funnel consists of five stages:

● Acquisition: how you find new people who are interested in your product
● Activation: how you turn interested people into customers
● Retention: how you get people to purchase your product again or continue using it
● Referral: how you get customers to tell their friends about your product
● Revenue: the money you generate from all these activities (which will ideally be much higher
than the costs associated with doing the work)
A simple acronym to remember this is AARRR.

AARRR funnels help you visualize how customers progress through the buying and
product experience. This is useful for identifying where people are getting stuck and
where we can optimize.

However, the funnel framework also has some limitations. Like the Five Fits Framework,
the AARRR funnel doesn't fully illustrate how customers and resources flow throughout
your business to drive growth. The funnel makes it seem as though growth is linear. As

if there was a finite endpoint. That isn't the case—especially not for startups that have
developed a scalable growth engine.

We'll turn to another framework to fill this gap: acquisition loops.

Acquisition loops
An acquisition loop explains how a scalable and repeatable growth strategy—the kind of
strategy we'll be helping you build throughout this program—acts as a self-perpetuating
flywheel (or "loop") to produce exponential growth.

A simple acquisition loop looks like this:

Unlike the funnel, your customers don't move linearly. Instead, they produce an output
that you can reinvest right back into a growth system, which leads to even more
customers.

Examples with loops

Product virality is a well-known example of a "loop."

Someone signs up for a product like Twitter
They have a great experience, and invite a few of their friends
Those friends sign up and invite friends of their own.
If enough people share Twitter with their friends, and enough of those friends sign up
and share, then the product can grow exponentially.

Ads is a classic loop channel:

You pay for ads on Instagram
You generate more revenue from the new customers than it cost to acquire them
You re-invest the profit into running more ads
Sales is another channel that has a looping mechanism:

You hire a salesperson
They go out and close deals that produce revenue
That revenue is used to hire another salesperson, who then closes more deals
and produces more revenue.
The loop repeats.
The key to all 3 is that you have obvious ways to scale the system to get more of
the "output" (revenue/customers) by increasing the "input" (sales).

This isn't to say that you're guaranteed to experience exponential growth just because
you hire a sales team or have users who are sharing your product.

Far from it.

Examples without loops
PR is a classic one:

You get featured in Techcrunch
You get an influx of visitors and customers
You try to get more features in Techcrunch, but they're only willing to do it during
big milestones
ProductHunt :

You launch on ProductHunt and rank #2 for the day
You get a big influx of visitors and customers
Throwing Conferences:

You throw a conference
You get an influx of leads and cash
You use the proceeds for another conference..... next year.
Essentially, one-off projects or ones that don't scale easily.

There are all kinds of different loops
For now, we just want you to be familiar with the concept of loops so you understand
how some companies have been able to design systems that produce seemingly
effortless growth.

Growth that looks like the solid line instead of the dotted one:

In upcoming sections, we'll dig into the different types of loops and help you identify the
best one(s) for your company.

Stacking S-Curves + Racecar Growth
Framework
Many startups fail because of bad ideas.

The rest?

Well, in startups, growth solves all problems.

● Low cash reserves? Growth means you get more revenue and can raise money
easier.
● Hate your cofounder? Growth makes it easier to ignore. The real fights happen
during the hard times.
● No systems or processes? Growth lets you throw more resources at it.
● Struggling to hire top talent? Growth makes you more attractive to top-tier
candidates.
So, the rest fail because of a failure of execution.

They either never crack a consistent growth channel, or they run out of room to grow

because they failed to adapt before they hit the ceiling on their current channel, market,

or product.

That’s what happens when companies ride one growth curve (or loop) too long:

● Markets get saturated
● The competition heats up and copies what they're doing well
● Customer acquisition gets harder
● Momentum dies
Smart companies prevent this by mastering S-curve growth—a structured way to

expand into new products, new growth channels, and new markets before hitting a

ceiling.

Here’s how to do it.

First, what's an S-Curve
Most famously, the adoption of new technologies follows the S-Curve:

Source: https://hbr.org/2013/11/the-pace-of-technology-adoption-is-speeding-up

Notice that they all follow a similar S-shape (with some momentary dips). And how

they're generally accelerating. The Telephone was adopted way slower than cellphones.

What's missing from that graph is AI, which was around for decades and was slowly,

slowly getting increased adoption. Then ChatGPT came out, and suddenly, everyone

was talking about and using AI.

So AI had a decades-long ramp-up and then an extremely violent adoption which would

be a near verical line.

How S-Curves work
Every product, channel, or market follows an S-curve:

Slow Start: Early traction is hard. You’re figuring out positioning, messaging,
features, form factor, UX, etc.
Hypergrowth: You find a repeatable growth loop, and growth accelerates. With
technology, typically, it happens with some "killer app" moment like when
ChatGPT was released.
Saturation: Channels become expensive, competitors catch up, there are fewer
and fewer remaining "potential users," and growth slows.
The mistake many startups make?

Waiting until Stage 3 (Saturation) to launch a new growth loop for the next S-Curve.

At that point, it’s often too late.

How to sequence growth
The best startups layer new S-curves before the first one flattens.

Again, there are three types of S-Curves a company is fighting with:

● Product
● Market
● Acquisition channel
The slightly confusing part is that Product and Market are a little muddied.

A new product can enter a new market (Mac vs iPhone) or be the same market, just

with a much better form factor (Netflix DVDs vs Streaming).

Let's dive into each.

In terms of products, think:

● Uber: UberX → Uber Pool → UberEats → Freight
● Amazon: Books → ecommerce → AWS/Prime Video/Music/Medical
● Telsa: Luxury (S and X) → Mid-range (3 and Y) → Solar → Trucks (Cybertruck)
→ Economy (upcoming) → Semis → Autonomous (Cybercab) → Home Robots
(Optimus)
● Apple: Macs → Macbook → iPhone → iPad → Watch → Airpods → Airtags →
Vision
● Airbnb: Homes → Experiences → ??? (they'll need something or they'll stanate)
Note: Many of these expansions were larger (or more profitable) opportunities than their

earlier products (iPhone, Macbook, AWS, Model Y), but some were smaller

opportunities that added additional revenue per customer (Watch, Airpods,

Experiences).

Sometimes, it's obvious that it's a bigger or smaller opportunity, and other times, it's a

gamble. For example, Apple Vision, Uber Freight, and Tesla's upcoming products like

Semi, Cybercab, and Optimus are either going to be big winners or not—time will tell.

Also note: Unless Airbnb can find its next S-Curve, it may lose its dominance and stop

growing due to saturation, competition, and regulation. Experiences are a small portion

of their revenue currently.

In terms of markets, think:

Expanding into new markets can be done by opening the same product to more people

or creating a new product that targets a different market (for example, Amazon AWS

was a totally different market than those buying books, and you could argue that the

buyer of a Model S is quite different than that of a Model X or 3 or Y).

● Slack: Developers → Startups → Enterprises
● PayPal: eBay payments → Peer-to-peer payments → B2B → Crypto
● Shopify: Small businesses → Enterprise → Retail POS (new product)
● Square: Small business payments → Enterprise solutions → Consumer banking
(Cash App) → Crypto
As mentioned market and product can be a bit muddied because:

A new product can add additional revenue from the same market/customer, or it
can go after a different market entirely.
The same product can be sold as-is or slightly adapted for a new market.
In terms of growth channels, think:

● Dropbox: Paid ads → Referral program → B2B partnerships
● HubSpot: Content → Sales-led growth → Community-driven growth
● TikTok: Organic viral loops → Influencer partnerships → Paid advertising
For primary growth channels, reference Lenny's Racecar Growth Framework's " Growth

Engine " section:

Source: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-racecar-growth-frameworkexpanded

Everything else (Kickstarts, Fuel, Lubricants, Turbo boosts) help with conversions or to

kickstart growth, but only the Growth Engines are likely to produce these S-Curves.

Note: For each new product and market a company creates, they also create

separate S-Curves for growth channels.

For example, Square could saturate the market on Meta Ads for small business

payments, then launch the Cash App, and massively open up Meta Ads again with the

consumer market.

Here’s how to sequence your growth properly:
#1. Find your next S-Curve early

● Identify adjacent customer needs. What else do your existing users struggle
with? Ex: Canva started with social media graphics, then expanded into
presentations and video.
● Alternatively, look for new growth channels. Ex: Dropbox shifted from paid ads to
referral-based growth to sales.
● Or explore new markets. Ex: Stripe expanded from startups to enterprise
payments to government integrations to crypto payments.
#2. Expand through existing distribution

● Ideally, your new product, channel, or market can leverage your existing user
base. Either through product-led growth or through broadcast marketing (email +
social).
○ Slack grew through developers, to internal teams, then expanded into
enterprise sales.
● You can also layer in new marketing channels—e.g., Facebook ads → influencer
partnerships → outbound sales.
#3. Test without disrupting core growth

● Avoid derailing your primary revenue stream in case the expansion is
unsuccessful.
● Start with small tests or pre-sales (MVPs, beta launches, new ad channels) to
validate before scaling.
#4. Time it before growth slows

● If you wait until CAC rises or retention drops, you’re already behind.
● Launch your next S-curve during your peak growth period.
Takeaway
If your startup is still finding traction, again, use the Kickstarts, Turbo boosts, etc to help

get your first Growth Engine going. Here they are again:

If your startup is growing fast, now is the time to plan your next move.

Spot your next S-curve—whether it’s a new product, growth channel, or

market—validate it early, and launch before your current curve stalls.

Not sure what your next growth curve should be?

Ask: "What’s the biggest pain our current customers still have?"

Their answers might define your next expansion.

Growth Process
As we've hinted, growth requires experimentation and testing to determine what will
work for your startup.

Experimentation comes in different forms.

● For your five fits, experimentation will help you adapt when changes inevitably
happen in your business.
● For your growth funnel, experimentation can help you figure out why users are or
aren't behaving in the intended ways.
● For your acquisition efforts, experimentation can involve testing different
channels or tactics within a particular channel.
Although the outcomes of experimentation will look very different for each framework,
the way you conduct your experimentation is standardized.

We call it the growth process:

Think back to the loop mechanism that powers acquisition. Loops are important
because we can reinvest outputs (users, customers, and revenue) into the channel,
increasing growth.

The growth process is the same, except the outputs are learnings and information
instead of revenue.

The growth process guides everything we do. And, if leveraged properly, it leads to a
competitive advantage.

Since growth is hard and all companies compete for the same eyeballs on many
channels, how do you win?

You win by accelerating your learning.

The more and the faster you learn, the better you can compete and build defensibility.

Throughout the program, we'll help you analyze your results, extract learnings, and
determine how to apply them. This will be an ongoing process during your time in
the program and beyond.

Introduction: Market and Customer
Research
Questions answered in this module
● Why do market research and customer research matter?
● How do I figure out who my target customers are?
● What are the methods for doing market and customer research?
● How do I perform customer research for my product?
Why you need to understand your market
New founders often start out thinking, “Our market is huge! Everyone will buy our
product!”

The reality: there’s a specific market for every product. And selling to them—versus
everyone in general—is a key distinction.

Before we dive in, here’s how we’ll be using the terms “market” and “customer”
throughout this chapter:

● Market: the broad group of people interested in a product, including both buyers
(customers) and sellers (your brand and competitors)
● Customer: the people most likely to buy your product, which makes up a
smaller, more segmented part of your total market
Next, every company needs to do market and customer research:

● Pre-launch: Research validates market demand for a potential product. It also
uncovers new problems that need solving.
● Post-launch: Research guides companies toward improving their existing
product, getting more customers, and retaining current ones.
Note that research is especially important for early-stage companies facing “ market
risk ”—that is, when you’re not sure if anyone wants your product enough to pay for it.

Here’s a quick framework to find out if you should be focusing more on market and
customer research:

Do most customers know your product’s main value props?
Do people group your product accurately with the right competitors?
Are people who rejected similar products willing to try yours?
Do customers recommend your product to others?
Would customers be upset if your product suddenly disappeared?
If you’ve answered more than one question with a no, there’s probably some disconnect
between your brand and your target customers—and you need to do more market and
customer research to align them together.

Ultimately, your brand is how the market views it, not how you view it.

Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) framework
There are many ways to structure your customer research, but we recommend using
the jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) framework.

According to this framework:

● Customers are users who hire products to complete a specific job.
● Products help complete a user’s job.
● If the product does the job well, users will hire that product again. Otherwise,
they’ll fire it and hire a different product.
Here's a overview from one of the creators of the framework:

Note: Yes, it is weird to say, "I hired a milkshake."

According to the JTBD framework, companies should ask, “What job are people hiring
my product for?” This is a customer-centered approach, where companies design
products around meeting users’ real-life needs, aka jobs.

Companies oftentimes use their competitors to guide product development. They ask,
“What would make my product better than the competitors?”

Example: local hotels try to outdo one another by providing better amenities and
customer service.

But, consider Airbnb. Part of its success comes not from offering better amenities or
customer service than hotels, but by excelling at a job hotels don’t complete: providing
stays with more local personality.

Similarly, other major companies design their products around jobs specific to their
target users’ needs—not in comparison to their competition. Here are a few examples:

● Robinhood : Make investing easy and accessible for retail consumers
● Zoom : Virtually connect remote teams
● Warby Parker : Make stylish designer eyewear affordable
The JTBD framework further helps you understand the job so you can build a better
product.

For pre-launch companies, that means using this framework to validate market
demand.

● What problems do people encounter and hire products for?
● What job needs to be done for which no good products exist? (DIY solutions by
users are often a sign of unfulfilled jobs.)
For post-launch companies, the JTBD framework helps pinpoint where and how your
product provides the most value.

● What exactly is the job your product should be hired for?
● And how can you optimize your product for that job?
JTBD and your ideal audience
The JTBD framework defines your ideal audience as more than a list of demographics.
Indeed, categorizing users based on certain traits can be helpful, but it also limits your
understanding of who benefits from your product.

So, who is your ideal audience? These are the users who:

● Face the problem your product addresses
● Would pay to solve this problem
● Are unhappy with a competitor
● Have an urgent need to switch to you
Here’s a framework for identifying your ideal audience based on how users view your
problem:

Urgency: How quickly do they want to solve it?
Agency: How willing are they to solve it?
Ability: How able are they to solve it?
Your ideal users have high urgency and agency and low ability. They can’t solve their
problem on their own and are motivated to solve it quickly.

Take Shopify for example.

All kinds of businesses use Shopify—there isn’t just one demographic or industry it’s
useful for. But its ideal audience is mostly made up of small businesses and
entrepreneurs who don’t have tech backgrounds and want to easily sell products online.
These users:

● Want to begin selling goods online ASAP (high urgency)
● Have the means and desire to invest in an all-in-one selling platform (high
agency)
● Don’t know how to set up an ecommerce business on their own (low ability)
Compare that to less-than-ideal customers, who include:

● People who only want to sell products locally (low urgency)
● Casual hobbyists and craftspeople—to them, selling things is more for fun (low
agency)
● Experienced programmers who can create an online shop from scratch (high
ability)
Job requirements
Using the JTBD framework, the product revolves around the job, which is a task with
both functional and emotional job aspects:

● Functional: The practical physical requirements that get a job done
● Emotional: The underlying desires and emotions required for jobs to feel
complete
You must define both to understand the job that needs to be done.

Consider DoorDash.

● Functional : Quickly order food delivery online.
● Emotional : Convenience and security, thanks to the app and contactless
payments. Many people don't want to call a restaurant or interact with a delivery
driver because they're in pajamas, sick, or deep into a weed gummy.
Your product must fulfill both functional and emotional jobs that need to be done—or
customers are less likely to hire it.

A real-life example of the JTBD framework
Twine creates software to help companies stay organized. In 2019, it seemed to be
doing well—it had happy customers and consistent growth.

But despite Twine’s “success,” its team struggled to focus because customers used the
product in many different ways. Deciding which features were most compelling and
which new product features should be prioritized was difficult.

Twine’s team used the JTBD framework to determine what exactly to focus on. They:

● Interviewed their most active users
● Studied sales call notes and CRM data
● Analyzed customer support tickets and app usage
This helped Twine’s team find where customers found the most value in their product. It
also uncovered how customers viewed their own needs and the language they used to
describe the product—which Twine quickly made changes to accommodate in its
product and marketing.

Today, Twine focuses on the most important jobs its users want to hire for: centralizing
team info, integrating tools, and connecting different people.

How to determine your product's job
The original JTBD philosophy is built upon using interviews for customer research. User
interviews are important but not feasible for every company because of budget and
resources. Instead, we recommend using a mix of research methods to determine your
product’s job.

Method Best for Challenges
Live
interview
s
Getting deeper insights Costly, time-consuming
Surveys Collecting info more widely Less depth and detail
Field
research
Observing real-life behavior Hard to implement
Existing
customer
data
Finding common trends among
current leads and customers
Limited to users familiar with your
product. Limited by size of current
audience
Market
analysis
Understanding whether competitors
complete users’ jobs
Limited depth without insider
knowledge
There are different levels of insight attained with each—so by using a balance of these
methods, you’ll get richer data and a more rounded understanding of the job customers
are hiring for.

Let’s explore each of these.

Interview prospects and customers
Though more time-consuming and expensive than other research methods, live
interviews get more nuanced insights. You can dig deeper to find out users’ authentic
concerns, how they perceive existing products, and whether these products actually
complete the job they’re hired for.

Remember that the job is the centerpiece of the JTBD framework, so the goal of your
interview is to uncover what exactly the customer is trying to accomplish.

In other words:

● How do customers decide to solve their problems?
● How do they decide for or against specific solutions?
Here’s a template script to help guide your interviews. We’ve organized questions into
four phases:

Exploring: What exactly is the problem? What conditions led to this problem?
Considering: What did the user do to look for a solution? What criteria did they
use to judge different products?
Deciding: How did the user decide on hiring a specific product?
Consuming: How did the user make their purchase?
Important note: As you interview users, focus on the how, not the why. Asking why
someone behaves a certain way doesn’t lead as well to accurate answers because we
tend to justify actions with new info learned later on. For less biased answers, ask how
users arrived at a decision.

Survey customers
Surveys have less nuance than interviews but are cheaper and easier to run. You can
build them using Tally, Airtable, Survey Monkey, or Typeform, then find respondents
through social media, online communities, or your existing customers. Or you can pay
for respondents through Survey Monkey.

Note: For surveys, the data quality depends on where you source responses from, how
well-written the survey is, and how you incentivize participation.

Pre-launch companies that want to validate their market and better understand a
problem should ask survey questions like:

● What is your relationship like with [topic/problem]?
● Are you using multiple products?
● What’s the outcome you’re looking for?
● How important is solving this problem to you?
Post-launch companies should use surveys to determine the value customers get from
their product. Ask these four questions:

What’s the main benefit you get from our product?
How can we improve our product for you?
How would you feel if you could no longer use our product?
○ Not disappointed, somewhat disappointed, very disappointed
What would you use to solve the problem if you could no longer use our product?
Pay attention to the second-last question. If most people answer “not disappointed,” it’s
a good sign that your product doesn’t quite get a job done or that the job isn’t that
important to them. Your goal should be to have more people who would be very
disappointed if they could no longer use your product—research shows that if 40% of
users respond “very disappointed,” your product probably satisfies market demand.

And for the last question, if people say, "I don't know," that's a great sign you're offering
unique value.

Do field research
People aren’t always aware of their motivations. Instead of getting someone’s thoughts
about how they might behave, observe them in their natural environment to capture real
user behavior.

Examples:

● Get users to send over screen recordings using Loom to observe how someone
does a task online. Ask users to talk out loud through their thought process.
● Use a heatmap tool like Hotjar to track how users interact with your website, like
what they click on or point to with their cursor.
● Find and attend industry-relevant events. Take notes on how people behave, like
which booths at a conference get the most visits.
● Assemble a focus group to discuss topics relevant to your company/product. This
is especially useful for B2B customers because focus groups simulate multiple
stakeholders.
Review existing customer data
The data you already have about your customers can clue you into what job they’re
hiring your product for—and whether your product is succeeding at it. This data
includes:

● Customer behavior and usage data
● Notes from sales calls
● Customer support tickets and emails
● User reviews and feedback
Look for trends in this data, such as:

● Who your current customers are: What kinds of customers use your product
more actively? If different types of customers use your product, is there one
industry, job title, etc., that’s more common?
● What customers use your product for: Is it the core value prop you advertise?
What features do customers use most?
● Where your product meets expectations and where it falls short: What
features do users praise the most? What new features or improvements do they
ask for? And what features are they most unhappy with?
● How your product makes customers feel: What emotions do satisfied
customers use to describe their experience with your product? What about
unsatisfied customers?
Study the current market
Although you can’t tap into other companies’ databases, you can use other research
methods to study your competitors:

● Interview or survey people who use competitors’ products. Use Slack, Facebook
groups, etc., to find them.
● Observe and record competitor products in action.
● Read reviews and social media posts about your competitors.
The goal here : Find out what jobs competitor products do.

Do they fully complete the job they’re hired for? Is that job the same as your product’s?
Would customers fire your product to hire theirs?

Important note : Market analysis isn't about comparing your product’s features with
another company’s and trying to imitate or outdo them. Doing this takes away from the
user’s needs—companies end up developing product features that are nice to have but
irrelevant to the job.

Looking at other products, you may realize that your perceived competitors aren’t
actually competitors because they’re doing a different job. This can help clarify your own
product’s job and what exactly it’s competing against.

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings once described how Netflix competes with not just other
video networks but also playing board games and drinking wine—any activities that help
people relax (Netflix’s real job).

Leveraging your market and customer
research
Once you’ve collected market and customer data, transform your research into
actionable insights to begin making optimizations. Here are three ways to leverage your
data:

● Customer personas
● The customer/market profile
● The customer journey map
These are the deliverables that result from all the research you did in this chapter. With
these in hand, you can begin making decisions—and getting the rest of your team on
board.

1. Customer personas
Customer personas are fictional user profiles that represent your ideal audience and
are based on your research. While the other frameworks listed below can also
accomplish this, we’ll focus primarily on personas in this program. You can create them
using our template.

Personas tell the story of different types of customers at the moment they encounter a
problem—aka the job that they need to hire your product for. Giving detail to these
stories helps to identify customer pain points and personalize your marketing for better
performance.

A persona for the online learning platform Skillshare might sound like this:

Emily is a high school teacher who likes to dabble in art. She’s interested in honing
her graphic design skills, with the goal of starting a freelance business later on.
However, she's reluctant to take classes that require meeting in person or at certain
times because of her work schedule.
Customer personas help you understand why someone considers your product—and
the potential objections that you should proactively address. For example, the Emily
persona tells Skillshare’s team to emphasize how their online classes are self-paced.

Even without doing customer research, you can brainstorm potential personas for your
company. One of the best ways to do this is by looking at your current customers.

Identify your top customers and then drill into who they are. (If you have customer email
addresses, you can use services like Clearbit Enrichment to input their email and collect
more information about them and their company.) For example:

● What's their job title?
● Are they at a certain level of funding?
● Did they experience any major life events recently?
● Did someone find you through a support forum because your competitor's
software wasn't cutting it?
Look for patterns and trends in your data. Then bucket your customers based on what
you learn—each group should get its own persona.

Important note: Your current customer data makes a great starting point for creating
personas, but you should still do market and customer research. This way, you won’t
leave out any currently untapped segments of your audience.

2. Customer/market profile
The customer/market profile is a concept we’ve developed to aggregate all the
important aspects of your market research, including:

● The job that needs to be done (the problem your product solves)
● Your customer persona
● Your customer’s buying power and constraints
● How competitors and alternative solutions stack up against your product
Here’s an example of one we created for Demand Curve:

Use our template to create your own. Share it with your team and help them understand
who you’re building your products for.

Customer/Market Profile
(File > Make a copy)

Instructions: Use the information collected from your market and customer research to
complete this profile.

Who
● Who are your ideal customers? Briefly describe each customer persona.
Problems
● What is the main JTBD?
● What are the functional aspects of the job?
● What are the emotional aspects of the job?
Motivation
● Why are they motivated to solve this problem?
● How does solving this problem benefit them?
Urgency
● How quickly do users want to solve this problem when it appears? Can they afford to
wait a week, a month, etc. to find a solution, or not at all?
Buying Power
● What resources do users typically have to solve their problem?
Constraints
● What constraints do users face in solving their problem? For example:
○ Are current solutions typically expensive?
○ Does solving the problem require a lot of technical expertise?
Availability of Alternative Solutions
● How many other solutions (competitors) exist?
● Do other products adequately solve the problem?
Cost of Direct Competitors
● List your direct competitors and the cost of their products/services.
Cost of Alternatives
● List alternative solutions to the problem and their cost.
3. Customer journey map
Many people think of the customer journey as a linear jump from point A to point B:
someone sees an ad and then buys your product. In reality, this path zigzags, and it can
be especially long for B2B companies.

A customer journey map is a visual representation of the customer’s process to hire
your product to get a job done. Think of it as a timeline of the customer’s
decision-making process.

It includes the same four stages used in the JTBD interview process, as well as a loyalty
stage that comes last and focuses on what’s done to retain customers.

Here’s a template we’ve created.

Use this map to track:

● How customers’ goals and activities change throughout their buying journey
● How customers feel at different points in their buying journey
● Important touchpoints between you and your customers, which either move users
forward or end their journey
Besides describing what customers are thinking and feeling throughout their buying
journey, the customer journey map also accounts for how your company behaves in
each stage. The point is that, just like your customers, your company shouldn’t be doing
the same thing (like only sending discount codes) throughout the journey.

Look for pain points in each part of the customer journey, not just when users are facing
a problem for the first time. The goal is to understand how your company and product fit
into the larger context of a customer’s life.

How to apply customer research to your
marketing and product
Once you’ve identified the job that your product should solve, you can apply your
insights to optimize your marketing funnel.

We recommend the "Psych Framework" from growth expert Darius Contractor.

Think of it as a gamified measurement of customer's emotional energy levels as they go
through your marketing funnel (Darius uses it for landing page optimization, but we think
it applies across the funnel).

● 0 Psych = "f*** this"
● 50 Psych = neutral
● 100 Psych = "I'm in love"
Assuming they hit the site with 50 points of Psych, every positive experience adds to
their Psych (nice design, strong social proof, clear and compelling headline), and every
negative experience (confusing UX or asking them to do something) subtracts from it.

Here's an image Darius made to illustrate it:

Obviously you want to build up their Psych high enough before you deplete it by asking
them to do things like entering email, card info, address, add a profile image, etc.

Applying the Psych Framework is easiest for companies with a customer journey map.
Looking at the customer’s timeline and your research, consider:

● What barriers exist when users try to learn about your product?
● How long does it take for users to go through the signup/purchase process?
● How long does it take for users to get their job done after hiring your product?
● Where might users become the most excited or frustrated in their journey? Why?
Here’s how that might look in practice —once again, we’ll use Shopify as an example.

my products—I bet I could sell

member
Not all psych elements are in your control, like when people encounter a problem for the
first time in the exploring phase. Some elements are also inherent to the problem or the
market, like if there’s a large number of competitors for people to pick from.

Despite this, the psych framework is great for identifying elements that are within your
control, which may have been overlooked otherwise. You may find that negative psych
elements outweigh the positive in one stage, meaning more optimization work is
needed.

Focus on your customers, not your
product
Many founders justify focusing on their product and its features by claiming that the
product will sell itself. We’ve seen this across all niches and industries, including new
trends like blockchain, AI, and the Internet of Things.

But to hold people’s interest, new features and technologies aren’t the most important
thing. Novelty only gets you so far, especially as competitors catch up.

The biggest takeaways for market and customer research:

● The problem your product solves is what makes your company important to
customers.
● Without understanding this problem, you won’t be able to identify your target
audience.
● Use the JTBD framework and research to find out the problem your users most
want to solve. Then build or refine your product based on your findings.
Cheatsheet: Market and Customer
Research
We’ve summed up the most important insights about market and customer research into
a concise cheat sheet. Consider this a checklist for you to reference while doing
research and implementing your findings.

Step 1: Collect customer and market data
To find out what jobs customers are hiring your product for, use a combination of
research methods:

Interview users to get deeper insights.
Use surveys to tap into larger audiences.
Do field research to observe real-life behavior.
Analyze your current customer data for trends.
Study your competitors’ products, customers, and reviews.
The most important questions your research should answer:

● What is the problem people are hiring your product for?
● How do people decide to solve their problem?
● What criteria do people use to judge different products?
Step 2: Leverage your research
Three ways to leverage your research findings:

● Create customer personas to help visualize your audience as individuals.
● Use a customer/market profile to summarize your research in one place.
● Map out the customer journey to identify user pain points and behaviors
throughout different stages of the buying process.
Step 3: Improve your marketing and product
Apply your research to your marketing and product using the psych framework.

● Run through each stage of your customer journey map to find negative psych
elements that discourage people from moving on.
● Mark where these negative elements happen in the journey.
● Then optimize your marketing and product to reduce them.
Not all psych elements are within your control, but using this framework helps to identify
those that are.

Project: Customer personas
In this chapter, we identified a few different ways to leverage your market and customer
research, including customer personas. While we encourage using the customer/market
profile and journey map, we’ll focus more specifically on customer personas.

In this project, you’ll develop several different personas and then explore two more
deeply. Even if your company already has an internal persona doc, start from scratch,
following our structure, and see if you can come up with something different.

Part 1a
Open and save a copy of the Customer Personas project document.

If your company already has customers, go through a list of your top 100 customers
and drill into who they are.

Consider:

● What job titles do your customers use?
● How old are they?
● How much do they spend?
● Did they experience any major life events recently?
Almost always, it's easier to convert people like your current customers; it's easier to
understand their problems, and it's easier to use existing customers as case studies.

Based on your existing customer data, identify 3-5 personas.

If your company doesn’t already have customers, brainstorm 3-5 potential personas
for your product.

Think about the major pain points your product solves and what groups of people would
benefit most from it. Consider:

● Age
● Job title
● Budget
● Location
Whether or not you have existing customer data, write a paragraph describing each
persona in the Customer Personas doc.

Get extremely specific about the persona you’re targeting. For example, instead of
saying “Property managers”, say “Property managers at companies that have been on
the market for more than 30 days (i.e., that they’re having trouble renting).”

Also, name each of your personas—this way, it’ll be easier to refer to different segments
of your audience. It’s always better to go into more detail rather than less. We can
always go back into a broader persona and remove details.

Part 1b
Write out your product's JTBD next to each persona. Then, rate the persona on
urgency, agency, and ability.

In your document, arrange your best/highest-intent customers at the top based on
urgency. In the next step, you’ll create a detailed customer persona profile for the top
two.

Part 2
Open our customer persona template and save a copy to your computer.

Then, begin filling out the details for your top two personas. The file contains two slides,
one for each persona.

Remember that the more detail, the better. Being hyper-specific about your customer
personas will help you understand their potential objections and how to address them.

Part 3
Once you’ve completed everything, complete Part 1.1 of your Acquisition Strategy doc.

Introduction
Questions answered in this module
● Why should I do competitor research?
● Which competitors should I study?
● How do I find the right competitors to study?
● How do I leverage competitor research for growth insights?
Overview
Many founders think competitor research is important for staying ahead of rival companies.
That’s true—but early stage companies don’t need to worry about losing customers if they’ve
never had them in the first place.

Instead, competitor research matters because you can use it to grow your business. Specifically,
you can use competitor research to:

● Validate your growth strategy. Researching companies similar to yours can help
fast-track major growth decisions. Chances are, whatever business model or acquisition
channel works for them could work for you.
● Disrupt the market. By studying established competitors, you can find new ways and
opportunities to compete against them. Consider how Netflix went from mail-order DVD
rentals to online streaming to edge out Blockbuster.
● Guide your product messaging and value props. When you understand how
competitors market their brand and product to customers, you’ll be better able to
differentiate yours.
● Identify and vet growth experiments. Source new growth ideas based on what you
observe in your competitors’ strategies. Depending on the competitor, you may have
more certainty that a specific tactic will or won’t work.
All are crucial for accelerating your growth, but we’ll cover the third and fourth bullets in more
detail in our Value Props and Experimentation modules.

You can, of course, also leverage competitor research for product insights. However, since our
program focuses on acquiring customers, we won’t dive into competitor research for product
development. Instead, we’ll focus on how to find the right competitors for growth insights and
how to actually do the research.

Why do competitor research?
Well-established competitors have tested maybe dozens of iterations to find the best ways to
grow their companies. You can get these learnings in a much shorter time if you know where to
look. Even better, doing this research is relatively cheap, making it a low-cost way to get growth
guidance and source ideas.

That said, there’s one big caveat:

Competitor research shouldn’t replace your own experimentation and customer
research. No matter how similar your product and business model are, there’s no guarantee
that what works for one company will work for yours.

Not to mention, you can’t perfectly recreate all growth strategies, especially from older
companies. Many businesses found early success using techniques and ad channels that are
much more saturated today.

But the goal of competitor research isn’t to clone someone else’s successful business strategy.
It’s to understand at a macro level what worked for companies similar to yours so that you can
better prioritize the growth channels with the most potential. While you can’t replicate your
competitors’ results, you can get more conviction about which strategic direction to move in.

One final note before we dive in:

Don’t spend too much time doing this research. Take notes on your findings, but don’t put
together a comprehensive research report. Instead, take the next step and act on your findings.

Understanding your competitors
Most problems can be solved in a variety of ways. Chances are some of your competitors
approach the same problem you tackle in a different way or solve it for a different group of
people.

Because of this, there are two kinds of competitors:

● Direct: Companies that target the same customer base as you and use a similar solution
to solve the same problem.
○ Example: Uber and Lyft are direct competitors. People can consider either for
hailing rides.
● Indirect: Companies that sell something similar to your product but target a different
audience, or target the same audience with a different product. There are a few different
types of indirect competitors, which we’ll get into later.
Direct competitors aren’t the only ones you should research. Indirect competitors, specifically
those with a similar business model and audience, are just as important.

But direct or indirect, not all companies are dedicated to growth experimentation—which means
not every competitor will be worth studying. To filter out these companies, grade them based on
their quality , rigor , and relevance.

Quality
Low-quality companies won’t get you very far in terms of growth learnings. For more practical
insights, focus your research on high-quality companies. You can judge companies using these
three metrics:

Revenue: High revenue often speaks to a company’s growth success, even if they’re not
profitable. If company revenue data isn’t publicly available, fundraising makes a good
proxy. Look for companies that have received lots of funding from reputable investors.
Size: Quality companies tend to be bigger, since a larger company size may mean that
whatever they’re doing is working well enough to bring on more employees. A good rule
of thumb for judging size: look for businesses that have expanded beyond their
founders. From our experience, startup teams that have grown to 30-50+ people tend to
be more developed and of higher quality.
Growth track record: Companies that have had long-term, sustainable growth, like
Amazon and Uber, tend to provide more reliable growth insights than early stage
companies. Why? There may be hidden factors behind early stage companies’ success
or external factors out of their control.
○ Consider how the social audio app Clubhouse took off in its first year, with nearly
10 million downloads in February 2021. Two months later, downloads dipped by
89%. Given its short-lived growth, Clubhouse probably isn’t so reliable for growth
insights.
The best companies to study hit all three: high revenue/funding, a team with employees beyond
the founders, and a consistent history of growth.

Important note: Company quality is less important when you're trying to define or optimize your
value props and brand messaging. In this case, other early stage companies are better for
research, especially those receiving a lot of press or that have raised some money.

As new companies, these startups usually haven’t grown much yet, so they’re not useful for
getting growth learnings—but there’s a reason they’re getting attention. Study them to find out
their value props and get inspiration for how to differentiate your own. (We cover this in more
detail in our Value Props unit.)

Rigor
We use “rigor” to describe how dedicated a company is to growth experimentation. Competitors
that clearly invest in this are better for your research because they’re not just taking
guesses—they’re using the scientific method to figure out what works.

You can find out a company’s level of rigor through these three indicators:

Public experiment results: Some companies, like Pinterest and Uber, have blog posts
dedicated to experimentation. Do a quick site search of your competitors and phrases
like “A/B test” and “experiments” to see if any of this is public.
Growth roles: Check out competitors’ LinkedIn pages to see if there are team members
or open positions dedicated to growth, experimentation, or CRO. This includes not only
growth marketers, but also engineers and data scientists. Bonus: Some job descriptions
also give away a lot of marketing/product strategy, even future plans—in other words,
lots of free insight.
Experimentation software: Use BuiltWith to find out what paid analytics and
experimentation software companies are using on their website. Look at BuiltWith’s
Detailed Technology Profile tab to see whether/how long this software has been active.
Companies that are dedicated to experimentation often invest in more software and are
running it on an ongoing basis.
Not all companies openly share about their growth experiments, so how dedicated one is to
experimental rigor isn’t always obvious. Prioritize studying businesses that show at least two of
these three indicators.

Relevance
Remember that competitor research isn’t only about looking at direct competitors—you should
also study indirect ones.

Some indirect competitors are more relevant to your company than others. Here’s how to
classify them:

Different solution: Companies that solve the same problem for the same customer, but
in a different way. Example: Workout subscription programs like DailyBurn offer a
different solution from gym memberships. They target the same audience but offer an
alternative solution to getting in shape.
Different problem: Companies that solve a different problem for the same customer
using the same solution. Example: Uber Eats sells to the same customers as Uber using
the same technology, but it solves a different problem (food delivery).
Different customer: Companies that solve the same problem in a similar way, but for a
different set of customers. Example: Tinder and Raya are both online dating apps, but
while Tinder targets young singles in general, Raya focuses more on celebrities and
high-profile people.
Indirect competitors with a different solution tend to be the most relevant and worth researching.
That’s because even though your solutions are different, having the same problem and
customers means these competitors face the same consumer mindset and psychology as you.
The tactics that work for them are most likely to work for you as well—study them to find out why
their solution might appeal more to customers than yours.

Competitors with a different problem but the same solution and customer are next best for
research because they may be a threat to your company, especially if they leverage their
product to enter your space. Consider how Uber tapped into its drivers to launch Uber Eats, a
competitor to DoorDash and Grubhub.

Finally, competitors with different customers are usually the least relevant. If their strategy
applies to an entirely different market (one with a different psychology), you shouldn’t expect it
to work for yours.

How to identify the right competitors to
study
Talk to your leads and customers.

Ask what other companies they’ve considered or used.

Important note: It’s possible your leads will name companies that aren’t actually
competitors. This might mean that your brand positioning or value props aren’t very
clear. You may be emphasizing the wrong features, or you might be pitching to the
wrong audience.

Look through online directories like Crunchbase, Product Hunt, and

G2.

Search by topic/category and keep narrowing down to find both direct and indirect
competitors.

Break down your user’s workflow.

Look at how your target audience handles the specific problem your product solves.
(Get insight into this process from doing market and customer research.) Break this
workflow into smaller tasks and different products that complete each task. Here’s an
example of how that might look for someone writing an article.

The products that appear most frequently or carry out the same tasks as yours are
probably competitors.
Google your target keywords.

See what websites rank highly for your target keywords in Google’s search results.
Chances are you’ll find both direct and indirect competitors, although there may also be
a few companies from a completely different niche.

For example, if your company sells a productivity app that tracks time, searching “time
tracking software” shows other companies doing the same thing, like Toggl and My
Hours. The results also show roundup posts listing other potential competitors.

How to actually do competitor research
Let’s revisit the Five Fits Framework from our Growth Fundamentals unit:

To guide your research, we’ll be applying the same framework to the competitors you’ve
identified to find out more about their growth strategies. Use our competitor research
template to record your findings.

The first step is getting a high-level overview of who exactly these competitors are. This
basic info gives background and context about the amount of time and resources it took
for your competitors to reach their current stage.

Use Crunchbase, LinkedIn, or Owler to find this info, including:

● Founding year
● Founder
● CEO
● Location(s)
● Number of employees
● Investors/funding
● Revenue
● Number of customers
Also try Googling press releases and interviews with your competitors’ execs—you can
often find revenue data this way.

Then move on to finding out your competitors’ growth tactics, specifically by studying
their landing pages, ads, and content marketing. We’ll walk you through this—but
remember that your research here shouldn’t be overly concerned with uncovering finer
details like your competitors’ monthly ads budget. It’s more about finding what
messaging and channels successful companies similar to yours are using, so you can
better plan out your own growth strategy.

Landing pages
The easiest place to start with researching any competitor is their website. Pay attention
to how they describe their brand and products, specifically their:

● Problem: The pain point your competitors focus on solving. How do they relate
this to the user?
● Features: The design and tech behind their product. What features do they
emphasize the most?
● Pricing: How much they charge. Are any segments of your audience priced out?
Do they offer different pricing plans?
● Perks: The bonuses that come with the product, like early access to new
features, an exclusive Slack community, etc. What makes these perks
appealing?
The point of studying your competitors’ websites isn’t to do a feature-by-feature product
comparison with your own. Instead, consider how they’re communicating their product’s
value. What story does your competitor tell? How do they describe the benefits of using
their product? And how do they position their product relative to others?

For example, here are some notes about Otter.ai based on its website.

● Problem: The main pain point Otter.ai addresses is note-taking at meetings.
● Features: Otter.ai emphasizes its live and automatic transcriptions, note-taking,
and meeting analytics.
● Pricing: There are two broad pricing categories for individuals and businesses,
plus a specialized plan for those in education.
Otter.ai sells a voice transcription software, but its brand messaging focuses on how the
company improves productivity by making information more accessible—and doing so
cost-effectively. Its biggest benefits: efficiency and convenience. Interestingly, it doesn’t
refer to competitors or claim to be the best transcription service out there. Instead, it
positions itself as a necessity alongside other remote communication tools like Zoom
and Google Meet.

A/B tests

While browsing your competitors’ pages, you might notice URL parameters, like:

http://www.example.com/?optimizely_opt_out=true
This may be a sign of an ongoing A/B test—something worth noting because it means
your competitor is trying to optimize some aspect of their site.

If you notice this, open the same URL in your browser’s incognito mode. Refresh until
you see the page visually change. Then take screenshots to compare the variants. Use
them to find and reverse engineer whatever hypothesis they’re testing. That might be:

● New value propositions
● Different product imagery
● Social proof, e.g. testimonial videos instead of written quotes
Even though you can’t see the results of their A/B test, you can consider whether the
same variables are also worth testing on your site.

Ad channels
Another benefit of visiting your competitors’ sites: getting retargeted. Browse social
media and elsewhere without an ad blocker to see what retargeting ads appear for your
competitors.

Pay attention to the ads with the most comments and reactions. This might reveal which
ads are shown most often—potentially the most successful ones.

Besides retargeting ads, also dig into Google, Facebook/Instagram, and LinkedIn to find
out what other campaigns your competitors are running. Consider:

● Which platforms are they advertising on?
● What users do they target?
● Where do their ads send users? Sales pages, blog posts, etc.
If your competitors have focused on a specific platform, it’s worth checking out that
platform’s upcoming competitors—you might find lower CACs with these new channels.
For example, many consumer brands are focused on TikTok rather than Facebook
because it’s cheaper and less saturated.

Google search ads

To find out what keywords competitors target in their search ads, use Ahrefs.

Enter your competitor’s URL.
Scroll down to find Paid Search in the sidebar. Click to expand the menu.
Click PPC keywords.
Ahrefs also shows the top landing pages competitors’ search ads lead to if you click
Top landing pages. This is helpful for understanding how companies are segmenting
users based on value props and audience type.

For example, Ahrefs’ data shows that Vrbo targets travelers interested in vacationing in
the South, especially Florida. It targets several location-specific keywords and directs
users to a corresponding targeted search page, like one specifically for Gatlinburg cabin
rentals.

Creative inspiration tools
There are some great tools out there for finding, saving, and analyzing curated ad
creatives from all kinds of companies.

Not only can you use them to search for terms related to your industry, you can also
look up specific competitors.

You can then use those as inspiration boards for yourself, for your team, or for your
clients.

Here are the two tools we recommend:

● Foreplay: The tool we use internally with our agency to gather inspiration to use
internally and to share with clients.
● Atria : A competitor to Foreplay that also has some analytics tooling (at additional
cost).
Here's a walkthrough of how to use Foreplay:

Meta and LinkedIn Ad Libraries
Here are the links to the ad libraries:

● Meta Ad Library
● LinkedIn Ad Library
● Reddit Ad Library
These tools let you search for the ads being run by specific companies.

Here's a walkthrough of how to do just that:

If you decided to use Foreplay or Atria, then save any great ads you find to your boards.

Content marketing
SEO

Use Ahrefs or Semrush to find out the top keywords your competitors rank for, plus
estimates for how much traffic each of their pages get. Although they’re not always
accurate, these estimates give clues on what landing pages and blog posts drive the
most visitors to your competitors.

Take a look at the top-performing pages and how they’re structured.

● What types of keywords do they rank highly for?
● What is the goal of the content—to educate, entertain, sell, or something else?
● Who is the content written for?
Ahrefs’ Top Content option also shows which pages have received the most backlinks.
Don’t fixate on the specific number of backlinks; instead, consider what themes are
common across your competitors’ most popular pages.

For example, several of Zapier’s top blog posts are listicles about productivity apps.

Ahrefs’ data on social performance isn’t as strong, so use BuzzSumo to find out which
pages have gotten the most shares. Here’s Zapier again, with different blog posts
getting lots of traction on social media.

You can then cross-check these pages in Ahrefs to find out their organic keywords—a
great way to find the sweet spot of content topics that have high search volume and
reader interest.

Brand awareness

Use Google Trends to find out how branded searches for your competitors have
changed over time. These charts act as rough proxies for how well a company is doing.
If searches for a company’s name are going down, their awareness may be declining,
which could mean their growth efforts are failing.

On the other hand, more recent branded searches might mean their growth tactics are
working—but you should always take this with a grain of salt. There could be other
reasons outside of a company’s control for why branded searches have spiked.

For example, you can see that happen for WeWork in fall 2019, when its IPO failed.

Still, Google Trends’ data can be a helpful barometer for understanding how a
company’s brand awareness has grown over time. A steady decline is also worth
studying as a cautionary tale for what might have gone wrong.

Social media

When studying competitors’ social media, it can feel overwhelming to look through so
many channels. It’s also tempting to fixate on vanity metrics like likes and followers—but
these numbers are often misleading because companies can pay to inflate them.

We don’t recommend an intensive audit here—the goal is to find out if organic social
media is worth pursuing as a growth strategy. Focus on answering these three
questions:

Are competitors using social media? This isn’t just about whether they have
an Instagram page. Do they actively post new content? If companies last posted
more than six months ago or do so very sporadically, it’s a good sign that they’re
not really investing in social media. Or, if they used to create a lot of YouTube
videos but no longer, then it may mean that the ROI wasn’t there.
If competitors are active on social media, how are they using it? Which
platforms do they use? Do they partner with influencers? Skim through your
competitors’ active channels to get an idea of their messaging and the nature of
their content. For example, some companies focus on creating educational
content like HubSpot’s YouTube channel. Others provide entertainment, like
BarkBox’s Instagram.
How do users respond to their content? Avoid putting a lot of weight on
followers and likes. Instead, look at comments on your competitors’ active
channels. Companies can buy comments, too, but it’s easier to identify fake ones
(usually a single word or only emojis). See if users are leaving meaningful
comments. If so, what is the consumer sentiment? A few quick ways to identify
the most popular content on some channels:
○ Twitter/X: The Twemex Chrome Extension allows you to search through
the top tweets/posts from a creator/company. Simply navigate to their
profile and the sidebar will show their top posts. You can thens search
them to drill down further.
○ LinkedIn: The Kleo Chrome Extension lets you do the same thing with
LinkedIn.
○ Instagram: Study competitor accounts on desktop. You can’t easily sort
posts but you can hover your cursor over them to see how many likes and
comments they’ve received. Study posts with the most comments.
○ YouTube: Go to a channel’s videos, and click the Sort by dropdown menu.
Sort by “Most popular” to see which videos got the most views; then click
to see their comments.
○ TikTok: You can’t sort a TikTok account’s videos by likes, but the view
count is shown on each video thumbnail in their feed. This number is
insightful in itself because it tells you which videos grabbed users’
attention. Look for those with the most views; then click to see its likes and
comments.
Remember : The point here isn’t to dissect your competitors’ social media performance,
but rather, see whether users actually care about it. Authentic user comments are a
good barometer for this because only the most engaged people will respond.

For example, let’s look at the ecommerce company Beardbrand. Its website shows it
uses Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, so we’ll quickly scan through each.

● Facebook/Instagram: BeardBrand regularly posts the same content on these
two connected channels. Only a few posts get reshared by Facebook users.
Some comments are specific to BeardBrand’s products; many others are
enthusiastic reactions to BeardBrand’s videos. Instagram Reels get a lot more
thoughtful comments than static image posts.
● Twitter: Also an active channel, but a quick scroll through the feed shows a
pretty low level of user engagement (very few replies or retweets) on the majority
of tweets. This tells us that Twitter probably isn’t a great platform for reaching
customers.

● YouTube: Sorting BeardBrand’s videos by newest shows that it releases new
videos every day, with a lot of recent content in portrait orientation (probably
repurposed from Facebook/Instagram). When you sort the videos by popularity,
you can see that the most viewed are landscape videos—and receive way more
views than on any of their other channels. BeardBrand’s top videos also receive
thousands of comments, with many users showing appreciation, even gratitude.
Overall, BeardBrand’s organic social content is casual, friendly, and encouraging.
Looking at all of its active channels, YouTube clearly generates the most genuine user
engagement. The top videos are mostly barber transformation videos and tutorials—not
very promotional compared to the other channels, which announce giveaways or new
products.

While we can’t see BeardBrand’s conversions from organic social, this quick audit tells
us video content in this niche may be most effective, especially on YouTube. It also
looks like users respond most to inspiring or educational content.

Cheatsheet: Competitor Research
We’ve summed up the most important insights about competitor research into a concise
cheat sheet. Consider this a checklist for choosing which competitors to study and while
doing research.

Step 1: Identify competitors to study
● Ask leads and customers what other companies/products they’ve considered.
● Look through Crunchbase, Product Hunt, and G2.
● Break down your users’ workflow to see what products match each task’s needs.
● See what companies rank highly in Google for your target keywords.
Step 2: Grade competitors
Judge which competitors are worth researching based on their quality, rigor, and
relevance. Here’s how to judge them.

Quality: High-quality companies generally:

Generate lots of revenue (or have raised a lot of money).
Have teams that have evolved beyond their founders.
Have a consistent history of growth.
Rigor: Filter out competitors that do not meet at least two of these criteria.

Publicly share their growth experimentation efforts.
Hire dedicated growth marketers and data scientists.
Use experimentation software (find this out using BuiltWith).
Relevance: The best competitors to study, in order of relevance to your company:

Direct competitors (same problem, customer, and solution)
Indirect competitors with a different solution (same problem and customer)
Indirect competitors with a different problem (same solution and customer)
Indirect competitors with a different customer (same problem and solution)
Step 3: Collect growth insights
Research competitors’ landing pages, ad channels, and content marketing for growth
insights.

Landing pages

● Study your competitors’ sites for their brand messaging and to see if any A/B
tests are being run.
Ad channels

● Use Ahrefs to find out their paid search keywords and ad landing pages.
● Use BuzzSumo to see which pages have the most social engagement.
● Look at competitors’ Facebook and Instagram ads using Facebook Ads Library.
● View their ads on LinkedIn.
Content marketing

● Use Ahrefs to find out their organic keywords and the pages with the most
backlinks.
● Look up competitors in Google Trends to gauge their brand awareness.
● Look through your competitors’ active social media channels and see how often
users post authentic comments.
Introduction: Value Props
What you’ll learn
● How to identify the value props for your product/service.
● How to turn those value props into the foundation of your ad copy.
Why is it important?
The most compelling copy on the planet does you no good if you're not conveying your
value propositions ("value props" for short).

You’re proposing to someone the ways they’ll “get value” from your product.

Without clearly identified value props, you risk attracting the wrong customers and
delivering the wrong message.

Overview
Before you sit down to write copy, you need to know what to focus on. This is where
value props come into play.

From now on, you can think about value props as copy ideas. Whenever you’re stuck
for copy ideas, revisit your value props.

Your first step to creating effective social ads and landing pages is to identify value
props: What does your product do to improve the lives of your target audience?

Developing value props
Step 1
To identify your product or service value props, create a 3-column chart.

Here’s the process:

List all the bad (non-desirable) alternative solutions people resort to when they
don't have you. And describe what makes each one bad. For example, if they
don't have your fast car, they have to get to work in a slow car. What makes that
bad is how much more time you waste in traffic. Or less time spent with your
family.
With each bad alternative, write one value prop that highlights how your product
offers a better solution to improve on that bad alternative. For example, your fast
car gets you to work quickly. The value prop wording should encapsulate the
main high-level idea. Don't worry too much about the details yet (we'll dive into
that later). For example, the value prop could be "fastest consumer car ", and not
"X horsepower".
Finally, list a lucrative customer persona in a third column: identify the persona
that cares most about this particular value prop. And bullet point the top two
reasons why they care about it.
Here’s an example of value props for a fantasy football (soccer) app:

And another example for an online matcha shop:

(You can use a tool like Google Sheets for your chart.)

You may walk away with a bunch of value props at first. This is good. It’s always easier
to subtract than to add. Once you feel you’ve exhausted your options, you’ll want to
reduce your list of value props in column two to those that are most appealing to your
top personas.

The leftover value props will be the focus of your ads.

Ideally, you'll walk away with at least five value props to build ad copy from.

Step 2 : Identify the problems your value props solve
Now that you've identified your value props, it's time to refine them so that they serve as
a foundation for your ad copy. To do this for our clients, we use a spreadsheet to flesh
them out.

Continuing from our first example:

And from our second:

Here’s a link to an example that you can copy. We’ll use some of the copy from this
spreadsheet directly in your ad copy.

First, it’s important to remember that you want to use the language your audience would
use. This is where customer surveys become invaluable.

Second, skip the jargon (except if you’re in a super-niche market, it’s sometimes OK to
use industry jargon).

When you fill out this spreadsheet, do it as though you were speaking directly to your
audience.

Begin by listing out the value props you’ve identified in the left-hand column. Then, fill
out the following columns:

Problem

Get super specific about the moment your target audience has urgently experienced
the problem. This should be written in past tense.

This is especially important if you're a B2B product.

Most often, the problem involves wasting substantial time or money.

Some examples:

● Your company just lost a lot of money
● A key employee just quit
● A relationship just got ruined
If you're B2C, you might be a "vitamin" instead of a "painkiller". This means there might
not be a burning problem to solve. That's OK. Focus on the solution and benefits
section more.

At Demand Curve, we sometimes talk to each other on the phone as if we were
members of our target audience. We interview each other to flesh out our pain and
urgency.

Implications

Drill into the bad things that happen if someone hits that problem.

What happens after the key employee quits? What can't you do because you're wasting
tons of time? Does your company risk going out of business? Do you fear for your job?

We call this "twisting the knife". Once you've found an entry point with the problem, drill
into that pain more and more.

As you write out the implications of the problem, find the specific person whose butt is
on the line when things fail. Get super specific, down to the job title. They should be
losing massive amounts of money, time, or reputation.

Examples:

● If your company loses a lot of money, people are going to get fired. Which means
your job as the VP of Finance is at stake.
● If your key employee quits, it's going to take months to retrain a new hire. And
that costs $80,000.
● If you're wasting 20 hours a week on meaningless tasks, you can't ship as
quickly. Which means that, as the CEO, you're going to miss investor goals and
lose funding.
Solution

How your product solves the problem.

Examples:

● Ruby Plants uses machine learning to grow plants
● Our feedback tool keeps track of employees who are flight risks
● Sentry integrates with every type of codebase
Benefits

Flip the implications of the problem around and talk about the great things that naturally
come from the solution.

● Growing plants with machine-learning makes them five times cheaper. So you
save money.
● Keep employees around. Saving you months of time hiring and training.
● When every codebase can integrate, you don't write any custom code. So you
have time to push new features.
Don'ts / Common Pitfalls
Implications that aren't tied to the problem.

For example, if your customer's problem is "you just missed your taxi", an implication is
not "you always miss your taxis." That's a separate problem and value prop.

An implication would be "you missed an important sales meeting" — which missing your
taxi directly caused.

Avoid industry-wide trends

Don't use language like "80% of office managers don't know about plant-based snacks"
or "AI hasn't reached farming yet". That's not a specific problem that your customer
faces.

Instead, talk about your customer. For example, "your key employee just had an allergic
reaction to gluten" or "you have thousands of workers manually checking your chicken
eggs."

Project: Create Your Value Props
Overview
Value Props help you position your product and find the right messaging that will
resonate with your target audience. The goal is to write compelling value props that
you'll reference throughout the course while writing ad copy, landing pages, and much
more.

What you’ll learn
● The most compelling ways to pitch your product.
Project Set-Up & Template
This is the template you'll use for the Value Props project.

Part 1: Determining your value props
Reference the template you copied above:

List down the bad alternatives people resort to when they don't have your
product or services. And describe what makes each one bad.
With each bad alternative, identify ONE value prop that will highlight how your
product offers a better solution.
List down and identify the persona who cares most about a particular value prop.
Complete the Part 1 Table and determine the value props of your product or services.
This is the column that will matter for the next exercise. Bad alternatives and top

personas help you rewrite your personas to speak more directly and at the pain points
of the target audience.

Part 2: Determining your copy
On the next table in the template:

● Using the previous table, turn the value props into problems, implications,
solutions, and benefits.
● Complete the table below and determine the value prop of your product or
services. Write a maximum of 5 value props.
● You will use all of the columns below throughout the course to rewrite your
landing page, ad copy, cold emails, and more.
Part 3: Do a final pass of your Value
Props
● Read each row. Does each column naturally follow a sequential order? E.g. if
your value prop is “Get 2x more than any other card” then don’t make the
problem about saving time.
● These rows should tell a story
Part 4: Complete part 1.2 of your
acquisition strategy doc
Complete part 1.2 of your Acquisition Strategy doc and paste the link to your value
props project.

Project Template: Acquisition Strategy

worksheet that will help you concretize your growth goals, constraints, and plan of action—all in
one handy document.

Make a copy of this doc. You’ll see instructions in specific readings on when and how to fill out
certain sections below. Complete the readings and refer to this worksheet as needed. You’re
free to skip sections if you wish, but we highly recommend completing the entire sheet with Part
4 being the most critical.

Introduction
Questions answered in this module
● What is branding?
● Why is branding important even for early-stage companies?
● What are some successful examples of branding?
● How do companies define their brands?
No matter what product or service you sell, you also sell an experience—and branding is what
creates this experience. Think of this as the sum of all the touchpoints between your company
and its customers.

Consider how people share photos of their Starbucks drinks on social media. Starbucks doesn’t
only sell coffee; it sells a trendy self-image. People order from Starbucks to project this identity,
even if its coffee isn’t the best. In fact, in a blind taste test by Consumer Reports magazine,
McDonald’s coffee beat Starbucks—but that doesn’t stop Starbucks from being the most
popular coffee chain in the world.

Building a brand is ultimately about shaping perceptions of your company’s value.

With a poor brand, customers won’t want any affiliation with your company. They might see your
product as not being worth their money, or worse, a scam. But done well, good branding does
the opposite—it makes your product desirable, with customers naturally spreading the word and
even lining up for more from your business.

Our Five Fits Framework includes brand because it plays a crucial role in determining your ideal
growth strategy as well as your overall growth potential. Brand guides how you convey your
company to the world and much more, like:

● How you should build your product
● Which pricing model(s) are optimal
● Which growth channels you should (and shouldn’t) use
In other words, brand touches every aspect of your growth engine.

In this unit, we’ll explain why brand is a secret weapon for growth. You’ll learn about the key
components of a successful brand strategy and how to define your own brand for stand-out
results.

Why brand matters for growth
Many founders think that their product can sell itself. Or they believe that simply
implementing proven marketing tactics can lead to growth.

But without a strong brand, it's difficult for startups to grow past a certain stage. Even if
they're tapping the right channels, they can only go so far before hitting a wall. There
are three major reasons why:

● Branding differentiates your company. Psychologically, branding gives people
a mental shortcut by separating your company from others. Consider how people
recognize sign and billboard logos on the roadside as different restaurants and
businesses even without seeing their names spelled out. Done well, branding
makes products memorable; it triggers users’ recall.
● Branding amplifies customer relationships. We have a natural preference for
stories because they help us process information; they engage us and motivate
us to act. Strong branding essentially tells the story of how a product or company
can help us not just solve a problem but triumph over adversity. Seeing ourselves
in these stories makes companies feel more relatable—and since they resonate
with us, we’re more likely to become loyal customers. We continue buying from
the same company even if a competitor offers a cheaper alternative.
● Branding gives you a growth edge. Many modern companies take a rigid,
data-driven approach to growth. This method once gave companies an edge
over their less sophisticated competitors but now, this approach is the standard.
So it’s not enough for companies to be data-driven—they must also take a
human-centered approach that convinces prospects not just with reason but with
emotion. In a world where millions of companies constantly compete for
consumers’ attention, only the ones that emotionally resonate stand a chance at
creating long-term recall.
Here’s a real-life example of how brand work can lead to more customers.

A SaaS company, Stacker, hired our agency Bell Curve to refresh its product
messaging and design. This included creating new copy and visuals for its site, emails,
and ad campaigns, changes that ultimately led to an overall increase in conversions:

● Homepage conversions: +100%
● Landing page conversions: 2.5x lift
● Ad clickthrough rate: +22%
There weren’t any major changes in Stacker’s product, but rather, how it presented
itself. Stacker has a strong product, so the branding work Bell Curve did was like adding
gas to a fire.

But in many cases, a strong brand makes it possible for an inferior product to win over
more customers than a superior product—and to even charge more. Remember the
taste test of McDonald’s and Starbucks coffee—people pay more for Starbucks’ coffee
despite the fact McDonald’s coffee tastes better and costs less.

In short, brand amplifies the other pieces of your company’s Five Fits: it increases the
perceived value of your product and your market’s willingness to pay. It enhances the
product experience. And it boosts the effectiveness of your funnel and growth channels.
This all leads to higher conversion rates, retention, and customer lifetime value.

When does my company need to focus on branding?
Building a brand isn’t just for mature companies. Conversely, brand building is exactly
what helped established names like Nike to find success in the first place. Every
business benefits, especially early-stage companies that are:

● Entering a saturated market. Consider the thousands of retailers selling
apparel around the world. Though many sell yoga pants, many women are drawn
specifically to Lululemon’s because of its stylish, community-focused branding.
No matter its price or quality, brand helps to differentiate your product in a
crowded market.
● Competing against a very established name. Customers often conflate
recognition with credibility. In other words, when given the option, it’s easier to
trust a familiar brand over an unfamiliar one even if the no-name brand has a
better product. But branding gives underdogs a chance to defeat Goliath. Think
of how the investing app Robinhood built an identity around democratizing
finance (down to its name!) to challenge long-standing brokerages.
However, you may be wondering at what point early-stage companies should prioritize
building their brand. We advise doing different levels of brand work at three key points:

● Product development: Since branding creates product experience, you should
develop a high-level framework of your brand early on. This is a rough idea of
who your company is and what it stands for. Use it to guide your product
development, like which features to prioritize that align with both your brand and
target audience.
● Product validation: Brand work is minimal at this phase. Instead, use your initial
brand concept to guide product tests and collect feedback from users. You may
realize that your early brand idea doesn’t resonate with your target audience, or it
attracts unexpected segments. If you’re seeing poor results, move back to the
product development phase and modify your original concept.
● Early traction: Once you’ve experienced some traction (once you’re acquiring
customers) revisit brand in more detail. Invest in more robust branding work to
refine your messaging and design.
Again, brand building is a long-term process—so don’t try to nail down all brand details
early on. The point is to develop a rough brand identity in tandem with your product.
Then focus on testing your product and getting user feedback. Once you’ve developed
consistent traction, brand work should be included as a piece of your growth strategy.

Why does branding deserve more attention later on? It powers every aspect of
growth, with effects that trickle down to your conversions, click-through rates,
and so on. Because of brand, customers value your product as more than a
commodity. They trust your company and become repeat buyers and brand
ambassadors, eager to share their experience with more people.

How to define your brand
Building a brand isn’t a one-time task or project—it’s an ongoing process for as long as
your company’s in business. Remember, your branding comes across in every one of its
interactions with the market; it’s in all of your product(s), sales, and marketing.

Because of this, there are a lot of components to branding. Early-stage companies
shouldn’t get bogged down in the details, though. Instead, we advise focusing on these
four foundational elements:

● Mission statement
● Company story
● Brand voice
● Brand design
Here’s the 80/20 on each

Mission statement
Your company’s mission statement is a short description (usually no more than one
sentence) of its main goals. It serves both an external and internal purpose:

● Externally, it communicates what your company cares about to better relate to
customers.
● Internally, it guides strategic decisions about your product, business model, ideal
audience, and acquisition channels (the other four pieces of your company’s Five
Fits).
Here are a few examples:

● Slack : Make work life simpler, more pleasant and more productive.
● Uber : We ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion.
● Tesla : To accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
Your mission statement should be a concise, high-level statement. It shouldn’t get into
the weeds of what products or services you create. Consider how in the examples
above, Slack’s mission doesn’t mention “messaging app.” Similarly, Uber doesn’t say
anything about ridesharing, bike and scooter rentals, or food delivery; and Tesla doesn’t
refer to its electric cars or solar panels.

Company story
Think of your company story as a more detailed expansion of your mission statement.
It’s a narrative about how your company came to be and why it does what it does.

The most effective company stories stir emotion. Remember that as humans, we’re
drawn to stories because they engage and inspire us. They help us process information
in a much more memorable way than simply reading a list of statistics.

There are two philosophies for how to frame your company story:

Origin: This approach focuses on you, the founder, and how your company
came to be. It’s best for those with interesting or unusual backgrounds. Consider
how a broke Sophia Amoruso opened an eBay store for her vintage finds, which
eventually became the Nasty Gal fashion brand.
Consumer-focused: This approach places customers as the focal point of the
company story, describing how they inspired your product or how your product
fits into their life. These stories work best for companies that have more
straightforward origins, e.g., you saw an unmet need and created a product to
address it.
Neither approach is better than the other—they’re simply different storytelling methods.
That said, both approaches should tie your company’s success to the customer in some
way.

Here’s an example of an origin story from Airbnb:

Using the origin approach, Airbnb tells the story of how its founders hosted guests in
their apartment. But it still ties this narrative to its customers, noting that both hosts and
guests create the deeper connection that sets Airbnb apart. So despite initially focusing
on its founders, Airbnb’s story positions customers as a part of its success.

Companies that don’t have an emotionally compelling history might struggle to create
an origin story that feels authentic. In this case, it’s better to write your company story
using a consumer-focused approach.

Here’s an example from the ballpoint pen company BIC.

Notice how BIC describes itself as giving consumers “the power of creative expression.”
The story revolves around BIC’s goal to “answer a fundamental consumer need” rather
than details about its founders. It’s inspiring without being over the top.

Regardless of how your company got started, your company story shouldn’t just be
about making money. Give it some emotion so it can resonate more deeply with your
audience.

Some questions worth asking:

● How does your product serve customers?
● What value does your product provide?
● Why should customers choose your company over a direct competitor?
Tap into emotion authentically, whether through your interesting background or how
your product serves your customer.

One last note: Your company story doesn’t need to be long. Airbnb’s is 230 words; BIC’s
is 117. Aim for under 250 words. Keep it simple.

Brand voice
Your brand voice is how your company would sound if it were a person. It comes across
in all of your company’s communications, including its:

● Website: blog, site popups, product pages, error pages
● Emails: promotional messages, newsletters, order confirmations
● Customer support
● Social media posts
● Ads
A single adjective like “casual” doesn’t cut it. Your brand voice should have more depth,
like a real person. And it should align with your company’s mission and target audience.

Consider Dove and Old Spice, two companies in the personal care space. They both
have casual brand voices, but very different personalities. While Dove focuses on being
empowering, Old Spice leans into absurdity. Given Dove’s mission to help women
develop a positive relationship with their appearance, it obviously wouldn’t make sense
for it to use the same voice as Old Spice.

Since brand voices can be complex, many companies create guidelines to nail them
down. Here are examples and select phrases from three major companies.

● Mailchimp: “We speak like the experienced and compassionate business partner
we wish we’d had way back when. We treat every hopeful brand seriously. We
want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them.”
● Trip Advisor: “We don’t boss you around, or confuse you with jargon—we just
make it easy for you to find what you need, when you need it. ... We share our
enthusiasm in an authentic way that balances the positive with the pragmatic.”
● Dell: “Speaking with the frankness one would expect from a friend, the tone of
Dell is engaging and candid. We are bold enough to let the facts speak for
themselves.”
As an early-stage company, you probably don’t need to create a detailed style guide.
But you should give your brand voice serious consideration—we’ll walk through an
exercise to better define it in our Brand Voice project.

Brand design
Brand design revolves around the visual elements that represent your company.
Compared to the other branding components we’ve highlighted, it can be the most
expensive. That’s because brand design requires a high level of both skill and creativity.

Though it can encompass a lot, here are the most important components:

● A logo that’s unique and recognizable
● A defined color palette with 2-4 colors
● 2-3 complementary fonts as your company’s typography
● Company iconography—the graphic symbols that communicate specific actions,
e.g., a shopping cart, messaging bubble
● Custom imagery that illustrates your product, its benefits, etc.
● A cohesive website that uses all of the above assets
While you can develop your company’s mission statement, story, and brand voice
internally, brand design often requires outsourcing. Here’s what to expect in costs:

● For mid-tier and high-quality agencies , $50,000-$150,000
● For expert freelancers , $30,000-$50,000
Many early-stage companies can’t afford to spend $30,000 on brand design. So we
recommend working on your mission statement, story, and brand voice yourself and
spending no more than $5,000 on brand design. Use 99designs, Upwork, or Fiver and
focus on getting a logo, brand colors, typography, and iconography.

There’s no need to prioritize getting a custom website and images because there are
cost-effective solutions like website builders and stock photo sites. Consider investing
more in brand design when you can afford it (whether because you raise money or
generate enough revenue to spend the recommended $30,000 to $150,000).

We’ve seen companies try taking the middle road, spending a moderate amount on
branding, like $20,000 to $30,000. But they usually get the same results they’d have
seen with a budget of $5,000 to $10,000. From our experience, brand design is a
situation where the phrase “go big or go home” applies. As in, the top-tier design talent
and experts in branding are well worth their large price tags.

Examples of strong branding
Headspace
Headspace is a mindfulness app with a mission to “improve the health and happiness of
the world.” It does this by offering guided meditations to ease users’ stress.

Headspace isn’t the only meditation app on the market, but it’s one of the best known.
Before apps like Headspace came around, though, the practice of meditation wasn’t
very widespread. If you Googled “meditation,” you’d see dramatic silhouettes of yogis
and monks in a far-off land.

This kind of imagery was a challenge for Headspace: people didn’t feel like they could
meditate because it didn’t fit their lifestyle.

Wanting to make meditation accessible to everyone, Headspace’s creators needed to
reframe meditation to make it more relatable. They accomplished this by defining their
branding with three key features:

● A reassuring and positive brand voice. Headspace’s copy avoids using any
spiritual jargon or idioms. It’s to the point, but still maintains a warm and friendly
tone by framing itself as “your mind’s best friend.”
● Whimsical animated characters. To make meditation feel less foreign and
unattainable, Headspace developed friendly-looking characters as a part of its
brand design. The team’s product designers wanted these characters to be
welcoming and inclusive, so they deliberately made them ambiguous—neither
human nor one specific shape or size. Making them even more relatable, they
appear in familiar everyday settings, like bedrooms, grocery stores, and on public
transit.
● Visual metaphors about complex ideas. Mental health can be a heavy topic.
So rather than addressing it and other complex subjects directly, Headspace
relies on symbolic imagery. For example, it discusses dark thoughts by illustrating
a few scenarios, but never explicitly naming them, e.g., the thought of keying
someone’s car. These images, shown in Headspace’s whimsical style, make
difficult or intimidating subjects more approachable.
Many stereotypes paint meditation as a mystical way to escape from reality for a certain
type of person: those who are more spiritual, practice yoga, etc. Headspace flips this
script with its warm, friendly, and relatable branding. It shows that anyone can benefit
from meditation—and all it takes is a few minutes with the Headspace app.

BARK
The ecommerce subscription service BarkBox first launched in 2012 as a way to help
dog owners pamper their canines with new treats and toys. After becoming wildly
successful, it has since expanded to offer other dog-centric products and services under
the umbrella BARK, with a mission to “make dogs as happy as they make us.”

There’s no doubt a large part of BARK’s success comes from its branding. It’s warm,
lighthearted, and goofy—fitting traits to describe a company centered around man’s
best friend. Some of the most well-known pet retailers, like Petco and Petsmart, have
similarly friendly and casual brand personalities, but unlike BARK, they lack a clear
narrative.

This is where BARK excels. Consider its flagship product, BarkBox. On the surface, it’s
a monthly subscription box of dog treats and toys. But BARK injects personality by
creating boxes around a unique theme every month, much to the delight of both dogs
and their owners.

Though BarkBox could simply put together random collections of dog goodies, it’s
carefully curated its boxes to tell a fun story—”a monthly adventure, starring you and
your dog!” Here are a few examples of its past themes:

● Australian Outbark, an Australia-inspired collection with kangaroo and platypus
dog toys
● The Muttcracker, a holiday box that plays off the world-famous ballet, “The
Nutcracker”
● Bud Hounds, a set of “fur-twenty” toys shaped like bongs and joints in honor of
4/20
Product isn’t the only place where BARK infuses its branding; its personality also comes
across in its content. BARK speaks the language of dog enthusiasts, using words like
“zoomies” and “doggos” as well as silly puns and cartoons.

Here are a few examples from its website and emails:

BARK’s content resonates with customers because it shows a clear appreciation for
dogs and dog culture, just like its target audience. It’s not pompous or snarky; it’s quirky
and joyful.

And by leaning into this branding more than other pet retailers, BARK has successfully
expanded to a wider variety of products, like BARK Eats and BARK Bright. People
become loyal customers because BARK’s branding shows a real passion for dogs, one
that mirrors their own.

Zendesk
The customer service SaaS company Zendesk stood out when it first launched in 2007
with its bright green color palette, Buddha mascot, and playful messaging—a far cry
from more stiff and formal B2B companies. Its mission: help businesses deliver
exceptional customer service.

Though it was attention-grabbing, over time, Zendesk’s team realized the limitations of
their branding. For one, their mascot was offensive, and trying to build a story around
the character felt “weird.” It also clashed with their mission to create good service.

So in 2016, Zendesk rebranded. It shifted to a simpler geometric brand design, even
creating mini-logos to represent each of its different services.

As a result, Zendesk could:

● Show off its expanded product offerings. Its previous motto “Love your
helpdesk” was replaced with “Relationships are complicated”—pointing to the
different ways Zendesk can help with customer service.
● Better connect with customers. Since Zendesk’s team had avoided creating
stories around their old mascot for fear of offending people, getting rid of it meant
new storytelling potential.
Throughout the rebrand, Zendesk’s voice remained the same. It continued its playful
and conversational messaging, but with a new aesthetic that aligned better with its
mission.

In Brandland, the company’s detailed style guide, Zendesk emphasizes the importance
of communicating in a charming and “humblident” (that is, humble yet confident) voice.
It doesn’t talk down to users, and it tries to avoid being hyperbolic. In fact, Brandland
specifically advises against repeatedly calling Zendesk “the best.”

Here are a few examples of how this voice appears on its website:

● Champions of awesome free trials (homepage)
● As a company, we roll up our sleeves to plant roots in the communities we call
home. (about page)
● This is your gateway to the magical land of Zendesk, where we help you improve
relationships with your customers. (demo page)
● Our sale just got Suite-r (homepage)
For better or worse, Zendesk’s original design and subsequent rebranding show how
branding can shape perceptions of a company. They also show how brands can evolve
over time. With its new design, Zendesk could better appeal to users without offending
them, all the while continuing to differentiate itself from traditionally stuffy B2B branding.

Project: Company Story
In this unit, we walked through creating a compelling mission statement and company
story that resonates with customers.

After going through this process with hundreds of companies, we realized that your
company story can inspire new insights about your business’s goals and values—it can
help you generate ideas about your mission statement.

So we recommend creating your company story first. Our project walks you through this
process.

Open and save a copy of our Company Story project template.
Earlier, we noted two philosophies for writing your company story: the origin story
and the consumer-based approach. Decide which approach you’d like to take.
Some questions to consider: Do you (the founder) have a unique background or
experience tied to your product? Was there a unique inspiration for your product?
We recommend choosing the origin story approach if you answered yes to the
previous questions. Otherwise, focus your company story on the consumer.
Before writing your story, identify these key elements to help structure your
narrative.
○ Main character: Depending on which approach you take, this is either
you (the founder and other co-founders) or your customer.
■ Origin: In Airbnb’s story, Brian and Joe are the main characters,
with the story written from Brian’s perspective.
■ Consumer-focused: In BIC’s story, the customer is the main
character.
○ Supporting characters: Other key figures in the development of your
company or product. Your company plays this role in consumer-focused
stories.
■ Origin: For Airbnb, these were the three guests (Michael, Kat, and
Amol) that Brian and Joe hosted in their apartment.
■ Consumer-focused: BIC is the supporting character.
○ Setting: The context of when your company was founded, or when the
idea for it first appeared—think place and time.
■ Origin: Airbnb’s story takes place in San Francisco in 2007, during
the weekend of a major design conference.
■ Consumer-focused: BIC’s story takes place in a more general
setting—everyday life.
○ Problem: The challenge, conflict, or inciting event that affects characters.
■ Origin: In Airbnb’s story, Brian and Joe were trying to figure out how
to pay their rent.
■ Consumer-focused:: Before BIC, customers didn’t have very good
writing tools.
○ Solution: How characters responded to the problem, e.g., the creation of
your product.
■ Origin: Noticing that hotels were sold out, Brian and Joe inflated
three airbeds to host guests visiting for San Francisco’s design
conference.
■ Consumer-focused: BIC created a better writing tool (and other
everyday products) for customers.
Use the key elements identified above to write a basic framework for your story.
Think of this as the minimum viable story for your company—there’s no need to
go into detail. Focus instead on introducing those involved in the making of your
company and product: the characters, setting, and problem that inspired its
creation.
Answer our guiding questions with a few words or short sentences.
○ What is the main character’s relationship to the supporting characters?
(For consumer-based stories, the main character should be the customer
while your company plays the supporting character role.)
○ Did the setting impact any of the characters? If so, how?
○ What emotions did the problem create?
○ What were the consequences of leaving the problem unsolved? How
urgently did it need to be solved?
○ What emotions did the solution create?
○ Why should readers care about the solution? How does it relate to them?
Use the answers from the previous questions to add relevant details to your
minimum viable story. The idea is to make your story more compelling by
appealing to readers’ emotions.
For example, Airbnb injects emotion into its story with details like:
○ Brian and Joe became friends with their guests. (“Our guests arrived as
strangers, but they left as our friends.”)
○ People don’t just use Airbnb to explore new places—they use it to
experience a deeper connection with their travel destinations. (“They
experience a deeper connection to the communities they visit and the
people who live there.”)
Similarly, BIC translates the practical value that its product brings into emotion. Its
story highlights how its pens “gave everyone the power of creative expression.” It
then adds that it designs other everyday products with the goal of creating ease
and delight.
Project: Mission Statement
It can be difficult condensing your company’s goals and purpose into a concise mission
statement, so below, we’ve put together a short exercise to provide guidance.

Open and save a copy of our Mission Statement project template. Follow these
instructions to complete the document.
Project: Mission Statement
Write three separate sentences to explain:

What your company or product does:
How your company or product does this:
Why your company does this:
Use the three sentences above to write a mission statement for your company.

Write one sentence explaining what your company does. Don’t dive into the
specifics. Make it general so even if you offer multiple products, your sentence
still applies to all of them. A few examples:
○ We create software to make teams more productive.
○ We help dog owners monitor and track their dogs when they’re apart.
○ We provide live and on-demand TV and movies.
Write one sentence explaining how your company/product works. This should be
about your work process—so unlike your first sentence, it’s okay to provide more
detail.
○ We develop software to manage projects and tasks across multiple
platforms.
○ We create AI-powered cameras and software to record pet activity.
○ We partner with major studios and networks to offer a rich library of video
content.
Write one sentence explaining the why behind your company/product. This
should reflect your company’s underlying beliefs and values rather than market
factors.
○ We believe in streamlining work in one place to remove inefficiency.
○ We care about connecting dog parents with their dogs even when they
can’t be together.
○ We believe in giving viewers access to premium video content from every
major U.S. broadcast network.
Looking at the three sentences you’ve written, try to combine these ideas into a
single, concise statement.
○ We save people time by making the world more productive. (ClickUp)
○ We create simple ways for dog owners to always be with their dogs.
(Furbo)
○ We help people find and enjoy the world's premium video content when,
where, and how they want it. (Hulu)
Project: Brand Voice
Besides mission statement and story, we also called out the importance of defining a
specific brand voice for your company. But one common problem we’ve observed in
many new companies is the tendency to describe their brand voice in very generic
terms.

For example, a company might define its brand voice as “warm, polite, and
conversational”—a very uninspired description that only scratches the surface of
personality.

The goal of this project is to narrow in on your brand voice by distinguishing between
close synonyms. Even if you feel you already have an idea of your company’s brand
voice, we advise completing this quick exercise—it’ll help you further define your
branding.

Open and save a copy of our Brand Voice Adjectives list.
Sort the list’s adjectives by copying and pasting them under one of the two
labeled categories: We Are and We Are Not.
○ Adjectives that belong in the We Are category should accurately describe
who your company is and how its voice should sound.
○ Adjectives that belong in the We Are Not category are the opposite.
These are off-brand adjectives that don’t accurately represent your
company.
○ There is no minimum or maximum number of words you should aim for
with either category. However, your We Are list should be shorter than
your We Are Not list.
After you’ve finished sorting all of the brand voice adjectives, identify the five
most important adjectives in your We Are list. These are the adjectives that,
above all else, best describe your brand voice. Highlight them.
○ If there are other adjectives that are not listed but that you feel better
describe your company’s ideal brand voice, add them to the We Are
column. Consider these words as well when evaluating your most
important adjectives.
From the work you've done here, summarize your ideal brand voice in Part 1.3 of
your Acquisition Strategy doc.
Project: Brand Design Checklist
Since brand design can include many different elements, we’ve narrowed down a list of
the minimum assets new companies should focus on. Early-stage companies with
budget constraints should aim to spend no more than $5,000, but consider a design
overhaul later, when they have more resources.

● Logo
○ Make it simple—large shapes instead of fine detail so that even at a small
size, your logo is recognizable.
○ Avoid using many colors and drop shadows as they may create display
difficulties. Test how your logo looks in black and white to see how it would
display in its most basic form.
● Color palette
○ Aim for 2-4 colors, with 2 primary colors and 1-2 accent colors.
○ Since different colors evoke different emotions, consider color psychology
when creating your palette.
● Typography
○ Select 2-3 complementary fonts. Generally 2 are enough: a font for
headers and another for body font. However, you may also include a third,
highly stylized font to be used sparingly for larger headlines.
● Company/product iconography
○ There’s no minimum number of icons that companies should create. List
the specific actions users will take on your site, app, or product. This will
determine the number of icons needed.
○ You may also want to create icons to represent different products,
services, or features, e.g., a clipboard to represent task management, a
clock to represent timers.
If you have a larger budget (a minimum of $30,000), invest in a custom website and
imagery. Otherwise, use fast, cost-effective solutions like Squarespace, Webflow, Carrd,
and stock photo websites like Unsplash and AI-generated images from ChatGPT and
Midjourney.

● Custom imagery
○ This includes both illustrations and photos that will be used on your site,
social media channels, ads, emails, etc.
○ Like iconography, there is no minimum number of images for companies to
create. Consider the graphics needed to represent your company and
product, whether in its packaging, website, etc.
○ Minimalist brands often require less imagery, e.g., Cards Against
Humanity.
● Website
○ Incorporate all of the above design elements in a cohesive, user-friendly
way.
Project: Company Story
Before drafting your company story, identify these key story elements:

● Main character:
● Supporting characters:
● Setting:
● Problem:
● Solution:
Draft your “minimum viable story” below.

Answer the following questions with a few words:

● What is the main character’s relationship to the supporting characters?

Introduction: Acquisition Strategy
In the previous modules, you learned about the foundations of growth and the key frameworks
that explain how the most successful startups are able to grow.

You also learned how to conduct and implement customer research, and you identified the key
value props that you'll use in all your marketing efforts.

In this module, we'll focus on the most important startup activity: acquiring customers. Your
ability to acquire new customers consistently and efficiently is the key to growth—and one of the
biggest competitive advantages you can have as a business.

This module will teach you the fundamentals of customer acquisition that apply to all different
acquisition channels and business models. You'll learn the exact growth strategy framework
we've used to grow some of the top companies in the world.

At the end of this module, you'll know:

● The two major customer acquisition models
● The difference between scalable and unscalable channels and how to leverage each
● How to identify your company's stage of growth and what it means for your customer
acquisition strategy
● That there are surprisingly few ways to drive customer acquisition at scale (and you'll
learn what those are)
● Our framework for developing growth strategies, and for evaluating and prioritizing
acquisition channels
Most importantly, you will leave this module having identified the optimal growth strategy
for your startup, as well as the top channels you should begin testing.

Let's get started.

Mark Incomplete

The Two Major Customer Acquisition
Models
At the highest level, there are two ways companies acquire new customers:

Channel-led growth
Product-led growth
We call these "acquisition models." They're systems that are built to drive acquisition for
your startup.

We'll define both. Then we'll explain how each relates to your company.

Channel-led growth (CLG)
A company with a channel-led growth model is one that mainly uses marketing and/or
sales channels to acquire customers.

A channel is simply a method by which you reach target customers.

For example, many ecommerce brands focus heavily on advertising on social platforms
like Facebook and Instagram to acquire new customers. They're using a channel-led
growth model. (Facebook and Instagram paid ads are the channels.)

B2B companies that use large sales teams to find and close new customers also
leverage a channel-led model. In this case, direct sales is the channel.

Later in this module, we'll cover each channel in depth and help you choose the right
one for your startup.

Product-led growth (PLG)
The other major way to acquire customers is through product-led growth.

Product-led growth primarily leverages the product itself to acquire, convert, and
retain customers.

PLG typically applies to software. If your product is a physical one, it will be very difficult
to have a product-led model.

Slack is a famous example of a company using a product-led growth strategy. Slack's
existing users get value when their peers are also on the platform. So users invite their
friends and co-workers and pull them into the product. Once these new users sign up,
many of them end up loving the product, and they then invite their own networks to sign
up. This beautiful cycle continues over and over again.

Another company that executes a product-led growth strategy is TikTok. Users of the
platform can share videos they love with friends, regardless of whether they have a
TikTok account. At the end of each video, TikTok displays other recommended videos
but only allows users to watch them on the app. This design encourages people to
share videos, which in turn gets new people to download the app—no "channel
marketing" required.

This leads us to an important concept that we covered earlier in the Growth
Fundamentals module: acquisition loops. The compounding, self-fueling cycle (or
"loop") highlighted in the two examples above is a key feature of true product-led
growth. It's difficult to crack, but the rewards are great if you can.

So which model is better?
Startups are quick to ask whether one model historically performs better than the other,
and which one they should ultimately pursue. The answer isn't black and white.

● Not all products are designed for PLG: There are fundamental traits that must
be present in a product for your startup to have the potential for a PLG model.
For example, highly complex enterprise products are unlikely to succeed with a
PLG approach. Sales and customer success teams are necessary to
demonstrate the value of the product and help customers with implementation,
onboarding, and training. The product alone isn't able to drive the full process.
● CLG and PLG aren't mutually exclusive: Even companies that are a fit for PLG
still need a way to get early users to try their product. Early-stage companies can
leverage marketing channels to build momentum that will kick-start PLG. But
even later-stage companies will layer on marketing channels to accelerate and
scale their product. Alternatively, CLG companies can apply PLG tactics to
augment their core acquisition channels. An example of this would be launching
an incentivized referral program. It won't be the main growth driver for the
company, but it will allow them to squeeze more out of their core channels.
● Acquisition loops aren't limited to just PLG: Channel-led strategies can also
produce acquisition loops. While not every marketing channel has the potential to
generate a loop effect, there are a few that can. We'll explore them in the
Scalable Channels section.
● PLG requires exceptional market-product fit: For a company to rely primarily
on PLG, they need strong market-product fit. There's no way around it. But
early-stage companies need customers in order to measure and optimize
market-product fit. It's a chicken-and-egg situation: Startups need to use
marketing channels to build an initial stream of customers before concluding
whether they have market-product fit. CLG allows startups to acquire customers
and validate that they're ready for PLG.
● CLG is quick to launch: This is both a blessing and a curse. CLG tends to
generate results faster than PLG. But it also lends itself to more competition and
provides much less defensibility against those competitors.
● PLG is more defensible in the long term: If a company can succeed with a
PLG approach, it will reap some critical rewards such as high defensibility and
significantly lower customer acquisition costs.
As you can see, there's no definitive right answer.

Most product-led companies will still need to use marketing channels to reach their
target customers. For early-stage companies in particular, a channel-led approach is
generally necessary to at least kick-start growth. As such, our focus throughout the
program will be on executing channel-led growth tactics.

But we'll also help you identify whether a PLG approach could be a fit for your product.

Let's get into specific channels to help you determine which is right for your startup.

Scalable vs. Unscalable Channels
In the previous section, we discussed the two ways startups acquire customers:
product-led growth and channel-led growth. The primary focus of this program will be on
the channel-led model.

In this section, we'll dive deeper into channel-led growth and the differences between
scalable and unscalable channels. More specifically, we're going to pull back the curtain
to show you that there are far fewer ways to scale customer acquisition than most
people think.

This is important to understand for a few reasons:

It helps to demystify growth and acquisition. Many founders and new marketers
find themselves overwhelmed by the seemingly endless array of marketing
channels, tactics, and "best practices."
It will help you stay focused early on. Fear of missing out is real when you think
there are hundreds of channels you could be using. Knowing that 95% of them
aren't a fit for your business makes it much easier to focus.
You'll produce meaningful results much faster. Many startups waste precious
time and resources on channels that were destined for mediocre results from the
start. Understanding the potential of each channel will ensure that you're not
spending time on the wrong opportunities.
We'll now walk you through why there are so few scalable channels and what sets them
apart from their unscalable counterparts.

Scalable channels
There are many channels, but only a few of them are scalable. These types of channels
have two critical things in common:

High volume: They allow you to reach a lot of people. You can acquire many
customers and use the channel for a long time.
Compounding/looping effects: They have a self-fueling mechanism that allows
you to repeatedly reinvest the outputs of the channel (revenue or new users)
right back into it to produce more growth.
Channels that have these two characteristics are called scalable channels. If they
don't have both characteristics, we refer to them as unscalable channels.

Let's take a closer look at high volume and compounding.

High volume

The first critical factor is a channel's sheer reach.

Platforms like Facebook and Amazon have made it easy for startups to use paid
advertising to reach millions of people. Search engine marketing allows you to tap into
Google's billions of daily search queries. Previously, that kind of scale was possible only
through TV, magazines, or national news coverage.

That said, there simply aren't that many high-volume platforms out there. You’ll read a
lot about Google, Facebook, and Amazon in this program for a reason: They’re among
a small selection of platforms that reach a high volume (billions) of users.

If a key criteria of scalability is high volume, should you ignore smaller channels? Not at
all. For early-stage startups, lower-volume "unscalable" channels can be effective and

often necessary to build momentum. We'll explain this more in our discussion of
unscalable channels below.

If you're already acquiring customers and you're ready to accelerate growth, scalable
channels are going to be critical to your success.

Compounding

The second characteristic we look for when choosing a channel is its ability to
compound your marketing efforts.

Compounding simply means that each new customer or user helps to acquire
more customers. This is an acquisition loop, which we covered earlier. It's a key
ingredient in the most scalable channels.

Take, for example, organic content marketing on search engines. New visitors come to
your site by clicking a link to your blog post. Some will read your post and decide to buy
your product. As revenue comes in from these new customers, you can reinvest by
paying a writer to create more content, which will help you acquire more customers.

The key: each new customer helps you acquire additional customers.

Unscalable channels
It's worth reiterating that scalable channels aren't the only channels you can use to
acquire customers, but they're the only channels that will enable you to build a large
company—quickly. There are tons of other channels that can help you grow yet don't
match our criteria for scalability. We'll refer to these as unscalable channels.

Some common unscalable channels are:

Public relations (PR) Guest blogging Speaking engagements
Asking friends & family Engaging in online
communities
Organic social media
Event marketing Partnering with
influencers or brands
Affiliate marketing
While unscalable channels alone won't be enough to build a huge business, they can
help you gain traction. The following diagram helps to visualize this:

The high-scale channels fall on the far right of the matrix. But if we look closely, we see
that nearly all of them, with the exception of paid marketing, take a significant amount of
time to generate a return on investment ("Time to ROI"). Unscalable channels can have
lower initial investment costs and get you results faster.

And remember, for our product-led strategies (product virality and user-generated
content), we're dependent on having a significant number of users in the product to
kick-start growth in the first place.

This brings us to the most important reason why unscalable channels matter:
Early-stage companies need customers as soon as possible.

Not only do they need the revenue to pay their companies' costs, but startups also need
people using the product so they can assess their market-product fit before scaling their
growth.

Unscalable channels are useful for later-stage companies too. Eventually, even
high-scale channels will begin to saturate. They'll still be effective, but their growth rate
will hit a ceiling. Adding unscalable channels is one way to supplement scalable
channels.

Understanding Your Startup's Stage of
Growth
As described earlier, scalable channels are ideal because they allow you to reach a
large number of your ideal customers. And they compound over time. But what we've
found from helping over a thousand startups grow is that it's not always realistic to start
off with a scalable channel.

Depending on the stage of your startup, you may need to start off with an
unscalable channel to begin acquiring customers right away.

As our growth program moves from foundational concepts to tactical execution, it's
important to note that the stage of your startup will affect the growth channels you focus
on.

Let's explore the four growth stages:

● Launch
● Traction
● Growth
● Scale
Launch
Startup stage: You're just starting out. Maybe you just launched a product.

This is simple. Your focus should be on getting customers to use your product to assess
market-product fit.

We advocate for whatever it takes—which often includes doing things that don't scale.

Your initial customers will help you adapt your product so you can pursue traction (and
scalable channels).

Traction
Startup stage: You have a flow of customers coming from unscalable channels. Now
it’s time to find a scalable channel.

Main focus at the traction stage:

● Learn from your first users. Adapt product as necessary.
● Test scalable channels.
Growth
Startup stage: You're actively acquiring customers using a scalable channel.

At this stage, your startup is starting to show real growth. You have an effective team,
and you’re consistently acquiring new customers.

Most, if not all, of these customers are coming through the one scalable channel.

As you continue to grow, you may need to abandon low-leverage unscalable channels
to reallocate efforts toward higher-leverage channels that support your primary scalable
channel.

Main focus at the growth stage:

● Double down on the single scalable channel that's working to acquire customers.
● Abandon unscalable channels to reallocate resources toward the scalable
channel.
Scale
Startup stage: You're approaching the ceiling of your primary scalable channel.

Your startup has matured and is beginning to look like a real business. Various
processes are in place that allow you to grow your scalable marketing channel
consistently. You likely have a whole team dedicated to your primary scalable
acquisition channel.

But you're beginning to notice a plateau in the number of customers you're able to
acquire through that scalable channel. All the low-hanging fruit has been picked, and
your team is focusing on smaller optimizations.

Those optimizations matter, but if you're going to continue to grow or accelerate your
growth, you'll need to implement another scalable acquisition channel.

Focus at the scaling stage:

● Optimize existing scalable acquisition channel.
● Allocate resources toward finding a second scalable channel.
● Invest in multiple unscalable channels that complement your existing and new
scalable channel.
Stages of growth summary
Regardless of your stage of growth, focus on the task at hand. If you're still looking for
traction, that means being diligent with your growth process and learning as much in as
little time as possible.

But once you find a scalable channel that works for you, it's smart to take the
leap and go all in on that channel.

It's important to double down on a single scalable channel for as long as you can. It's
not easy. It will take time, resources, and effort to get your primary acquisition channel
working at full capacity. Once you find one that works, the ROI from continuing to scale
that channel will likely outweigh investment in new, unproven channels.

Now we'll narrow the focus of the program to help you choose your first scalable
channel.

The Major Acquisition Lanes
While there are many different "channels," there are only a few acquisition "lanes."
Lanes are simply broad umbrella categories that channels fall into.

For example, "paid acquisition" is a lane that consists of Facebook ads, Twitter ads,
Instagram ads, Google Search ads, and all other paid advertising channels.

After helping over 1,000 startups grow, we've found that there are only four major
acquisition lanes that drive scalable growth:

● Paid acquisition
● Content acquisition
● Viral acquisition
● Sales acquisition
We'll introduce each and highlight a few particularities that make them unique. After
discussing the four acquisition lanes, we'll revisit unscalable channels to consider how
they relate to acquisition.

Paid acquisition
Paid acquisition refers to any channel, tactic, or marketing activity in which you're
paying for new customers, traffic, or exposure. Advertising channels are the most
popular form of paid acquisition. Affiliates and most influencer campaigns also fall under
paid.

Note that we mostly cover digital paid acquisition channels. However, traditional forms
of paid acquisition, like billboards and TV ads, are also options. We'll give a high-level
overview of them in a future lesson.

Here's an example of what a basic paid acquisition loop might look like:

Advantages

● Short feedback loop between experimentation and results
● Strong control over the channel's outputs like price, volume, and target audience
● You can get started with very low budgets
Disadvantages

● Highly competitive
● Takes a lot of effort to maintain performance over time
● A "reverse economies of scale" effect: Things get more expensive/inefficient at
scale
Company types that work best

● Products with moderate lifetime value (LTV) or high average revenue per user
(ARPU). Low-value products likely won't be profitable, and expensive ones
generally struggle to convert via ads alone.
● Products with very short sales cycles
● Visual, aesthetically appealing products
● Products with simple value props
● Products serving large markets
Content acquisition
Content acquisition refers to acquiring customers by showing them content that directly
or indirectly relates to your product.

There are three broad categories of content acquisition:

Editorial SEO: Search engine optimization (SEO) is a method of publishing on
your website about topics that get searched on search engines like Google. Over
time, Google will begin sending traffic to your site if the algorithm deems your
content to be high quality. This traffic has no direct cost, but it will require you to
editorialize your content to fit within the search engine's constraints.
User-generated content: User-generated content (UGC) is content that your
users create on your behalf. For example, the vast majority of content on
YouTube is not created by YouTube. With UGC, content is created at scale
without increasing your production costs. UGC can be distributed in two ways:
1. SEO distribution: Similar to editorial SEO, UGC SEO relies on search
engines to send traffic to the content created by your users. LinkedIn
profiles are an example of SEO-distributed UGC.
2. Viral distribution: UGC that's distributed by the user who created it is
called viral UGC. A tweet that's seen by millions of people is an example
of viral UGC.
Viral content: Viral content spreads via sharing, not through search engines. It's
a fairly unpredictable strategy, but content can be designed with the channel in
mind to increase the likelihood of it being shared.
Here's an example of what a basic content acquisition growth loop might look like:

Advantages

● Doesn't always require direct cash investment—only costs time to get started
● Scales well
● Less intrusive than paid advertising
● Create once, distribute forever
● Traffic compounds over time
● Allows your users to become your biggest growth mechanism
Disadvantages

● Expensive at scale
● It can take a long time to get results
● At the mercy of search engine algorithms
● Competition (especially SEO) can be insurmountable
Company types that work best

● Product's usage enables user content creation
● Products or problems that have existing search volume
● Complex products or spaces in which education is needed
● Spaces or industries in which thought leadership, trust, or validation is required
● Products with access to (or the ability to create) proprietary data
Note: While all three strategies can be very effective, we'll primarily focus on editorial
SEO and viral content. Editorial SEO and viral content are channel-led strategies,
whereas UGC is product-led and therefore outside the scope of this program.

Viral acquisition
At its core, virality means that growth is driven by users of a product spreading the word
and inviting others to use the product as well.

People often assume that virality is simply word of mouth. But there are actually several
forms of virality. We'll examine the two major categories:

● Incentivized virality: As the name suggests, this is when users get an incentive
(e.g., money, product features, exclusive content) in exchange for inviting others
to the product. The referral programs ("invite a friend and get $10") made famous
by the likes of Dropbox, Airbnb, and Paypal are all examples of incentivized
virality.
● Organic virality: Organic virality can be broken down into a few different
sub-categories:
Word of mouth: Good ol'-fashioned word of mouth is a classic type of
organic virality. Users love a product so much that they invite their friends
and family. Word of mouth takes place outside of the product experience.
Pull virality: This is when users of a product invite others because doing
so increases the value they get out of the product. Slack—or pretty much
any other collaboration tool—is a great example of this. For someone to
truly get the full value out of Slack, they need their co-workers to join as
well. So users "pull" in others to maximize their own utility. Pull virality
applies to every social media platform, too. Instagram isn't much fun if
you're the only one using it.
Push virality: Push virality involves existing users exposing (not inviting)
others to the product through natural usage. This applies to both physical
and digital products. Every time someone walks around wearing their
AirPods, they're exposing the product to other potential customers. On the
digital side, take Superhuman, an email service. Every time a
Superhuman user sends an email, it says "sent via Superhuman" in the
footer. Again, the users aren't directly inviting their contacts to
Superhuman. But they are creating awareness each time they use it.
Here's an example of what a viral acquisition growth loop might look like:

Advantages

● Super low cost
● Scalable
● Leverages the most trusted way people buy: recommendations from their friends
Disadvantages

● Very difficult to get right
● Hard to control or influence
● Requires a critical mass of people to take effect
Company types that work best

● Products that gain utility with every new user (e.g., networks, social products)
● Products that are innately fun or social
● Products that are simple with a broad appeal
Sales acquisition
Sales tends to fall outside the growth marketing scope, but it's one of the top
channel-led strategies. Why is it so powerful? Because it too, like every strategy
mentioned above, is scalable. A salesperson works to find and close new customers.
Revenue is captured from those customers. And that revenue can be directly invested
into hiring more salespeople, which in turn leads to more revenue.

Sales consists of two parts:

Lead generation: Lead generation is the act of searching for people or
businesses that fall into your target audience. The goal of lead generation is to
identify a prospective customer and find a channel to directly reach them
through. Once a "lead" has been identified, it's then passed to the direct sales
team to make first contact. Lead generation is typically done through content
marketing, paid marketing, or cold outreach.
Direct sales: Direct sales is the process of turning leads into customers. Direct
sales can happen over the phone, in person, and sometimes over email. It often
involves educating and negotiating with a prospect until a deal is finalized.
While we don't spend much time on direct sales in this program, we'll cover lead
generation in depth.

Here's an example of what a sales acquisition growth loop might look like:

Advantages

● Allows for very niche targeting at scale
● You can create systems that lead to a repeatable and predictable acquisition
engine
● Unlike other channels, messaging can be tailored in real time, which can lead to
a higher likelihood of closing a sale
● You're able to develop a personal relationship with your prospective customer
● Allows you to explain your product in great detail
Disadvantages

● Very expensive
● Requires constant hiring, training, and up-skilling of your sales team
Company types that work best

● Products with long or complex sales cycles
● Expensive products
● Products that require training to use
● Products that require custom quotes or configurations
Unscalable channels
Unlike the acquisition lanes we just highlighted, unscalable acquisition channels won't
compound in effectiveness over time. They can't make use of their outputs and are
typically only effective for a short amount of time.

For example, public relations (PR) is only effective when publications are writing about
your startup. A single mention in a highly regarded publication might lead to a few
hundred signups, but it will only be visible on the main page for a few hours before
getting replaced by another post. Each new PR write-up will require the same amount of
effort to get published, and the results from one campaign can't be directly reinvested
into future PR campaigns.

Advantages

● Many are cheap
● Can supplement scalable channels
● Helps to kick-start scalable channels
● Less competitive
Disadvantages

● Doesn't have scale potential
● Many are one-offs and not repeatable
Company types that work best

● Early-stage companies looking to get an initial flow of users and customers
● Companies looking to augment their primary scalable channel
How to Identify the Right Acquisition
Channel
Now that we've introduced the primary lanes that startups can use to scale their
customer acquisition, it's time to help you narrow your focus to a single acquisition
channel.

You might already have a specific channel in mind based on previous efforts or the
descriptions earlier. Even so, we recommend completing this section using the
prioritization framework we'll show you. This will ensure that you've considered all
aspects of the decision before committing.

We'll walk you through an active exercise, so make sure you have a way to record your
responses.

Acquisition channel prioritization framework
Step 1: Define your goals

Every startup has a different goal. Maybe you want to build a product that's used by
millions of people each day. Or maybe you want to create a lifestyle business that's
modestly profitable. It's a choice that all startup founders must make.

Since we're going to start with one primary acquisition channel, write down what you're
trying to achieve through that channel. Imagine it's the only channel your customers
come through.

Be specific:

● How many customers do you want to acquire per day/week/month/year?
● Do you need to acquire customers in a set amount of time? How long? How
many customers?
Step 2: Define your constraints

Every startup will have a different set of constraints to work within. We'll help you
identify all your constraints so you can write them down.

The most important constraint that you'll need to address is which acquisition
lanes are most likely to work for your startup.

As we demonstrated in the Major Acquisition Lanes section, certain lanes work only
when paired with specific business types. Go ahead and review each lane description to
decide whether or not the lane is "open" to your startup. Be honest with yourself as you
select lanes based on your product, target market, and business model.

Once you've identified which lanes might work for you, define all other constraints, such
as:

● What kind of budget do you have to spend on acquiring customers? Can it be
increased? Will it be refilled once spent? Who's in charge of that budget?
● What results are required? Is there a time limit?
● Who's available to work on growth projects? Do they have dedicated time and
resources?
● What resources are available? Can more resources be acquired over time?
Now that you've defined both your goals and constraints, most of the prioritization has
already been done for you. That's because most channels have a very specific set of
requirements in order to be effective. For example, a small acquisition budget will rule
out most paid channels with high customer acquisition costs.

As we've mentioned before, channels are not in your control. Only your startup is in your
control. That's why we need to align you with a channel that will give your startup the
greatest chance of predictably acquiring new customers—even with your constraints.

Step 3: Use the evaluation framework

With your goals and constraints well documented, we can evaluate each individual
channel. There are seven criteria that we assess for each channel:

● Scale: How much of your target audience is on the channel. A channel may offer
amazing targeting, but if few people in your target market are on it, it won't be
useful.
● Targetability: How easy it is to reach your target audience. Your target market
might use a specific platform, but if there's no way to specifically target them,
then it's not that useful.
● Effort: How difficult it is to launch and maintain the channel. When assessing
effort, we'll factor in both the amount of time and level of expertise needed.
● Time to results: How quickly you can expect to see results from the channel.
Remember, the purpose of the channel is to acquire customers. That's what we
mean by "results." Metrics like impressions and engagement don't matter unless
you're acquiring paying customers through your channel.
● Intent: How likely it is that people on the channel will buy from you. Is your target
in a buying mindset on this channel? How close is this channel to your
conversion event? For example, a lawyer scrolling Reddit is going to have low
buying intent if shown an ad for legal software.
● Context: What your target audience expects from a channel, and whether that
aligns with your product. This describes how a user interacts with a specific
channel, e.g., the type of device they use, as well as what kind of content they
expect to consume on it.
● Cost: How much the channel costs to launch and maintain, and the average cost
of acquiring a customer
Using the seven channel criteria, we'll walk you through each of the scalable and
unscalable customer acquisition channels. Be sure to focus on the acquisition lanes that
are available to your startup. As you go through each channel, compare the channel
criteria with your constraints and goals. If you see a channel that seems promising, write
it down. If a channel doesn't align with your constraints and goals, move on to the next
one.

How to Evaluate Acquisition Channels
In the previous lesson, we went through a step-by-step process for how to prioritize
different acquisition channels. The final step introduced an evaluation framework for
judging individual channels based on seven criteria:

Scale
Target-ability
Intent
Context
Effort
Cost
Time to results
In this lesson, we’ll walk through this evaluation framework in more depth by looking at
each of the seven criteria. Channels vary in effectiveness based on a company’s
audience. Channels may even vary in effectiveness for a single company targeting
multiple audiences. We’ll provide examples so you have all of the context you need to
pursue your channels.

Since it’s difficult to understand these criteria from a purely conceptual perspective, we’ll
look at how three companies with different business models might evaluate acquisition
channels:

● Otter.ai, a B2B company with software that records and transcribes online
meetings
● Rareform, an ecom shop selling purses, bags, and accessories from recycled
billboards
● DoorDash, a food delivery app
Scale
Scale generally refers to how many people you can reach on a given channel.

For example, Amazon ads is a high-scale channel because you can reach millions of
Amazon shoppers.

Theoretically, you can scale Amazon ads. Certain companies can build big businesses
by using Amazon ads as a primary channel.

But when you’re evaluating channels, it’s important to also consider how many of your
ideal customers you can reach on a given channel. That’s the type of “scale” we’ll
discuss here.

While Amazon ads is a high-scale channel, not all businesses can actually scale their
acquisition through it.

If you’re selling a niche product in a category that won’t get many searches on Amazon,
then Amazon isn’t scalable for you.

Let’s look at Snapchat.

Most users are between 18 and 29 years old; only 38% are 30 or older.

Since Otter.ai’s product serves remote workers, it wouldn’t be practical to run ads on
Snapchat. Most of Snap’s users are high school and college students—not working
professionals who can make decisions about software for their companies. But for
Rareform and DoorDash, whose target audiences include Gen Z users and young
millennials, Snapchat ads have better scale.

For another example, consider SEO.

DoorDash’s market includes hundreds of millions of people that use food delivery
services. There are also close to 100 million searches related to food delivery every
month, making SEO a high-scale channel for DoorDash.

Rareform has a smaller, more niche market. While there are many searches for purses
and bags in general, few are specifically for bags made of recycled materials—only
around 10,000 searches per month. So SEO has lower scale for Rareform.

So when you go through the project to pick your acquisition channel, consider the fact
that channels have a certain scale—how many users you can reach through that
channel. Facebook has billions of users while Reddit has millions.

But then evaluate those channels based on how many of your target customers you can
reach.

Targetability
Targetability describes the degree to which you can target a specific audience on a
channel. Millions of your target users may use a channel—but if that channel doesn’t
enable you to hone in on that specific segment (low targetability), it would underperform
compared to a channel that offers such targeting.

Some channels enable you to target users by selecting a specific data point. For
example, with Facebook and Instagram ads, you can make your ads only show to
people of one gender, in a specific age range, and so on.

However, not all channels have this level of targetability. Think about all the ways you
can reach people with Google:

● Google Display Network (GDN) and YouTube ads allow detailed targeting based
on user demographics, life events, interests, and browsing history. You can also
set your ads to appear on specific websites and YouTube channels, or on sites
and channels related to certain topics and keywords.
● Google search ads rely mostly on keyword targeting—your ads appear for
keywords that you specify in Google Ads. You can also set some targeting
criteria like location, device, and language, but these options are more limited
compared to GDN and YouTube ads.
● Creating high-ranking SEO content relies on keyword targeting, except you don’t
specify your target keywords to Google Ads. Instead, you create content around
these keywords to appeal to specific audiences (like parenting articles for new
moms and dads).
Sales and digital paid acquisition channels tend to have better targetability than other
acquisition lanes. Sales teams can focus on reaching out to people that match their
exact customer criteria, and ad networks like Facebook let you pinpoint audience
segments based on user data. By comparison, content and viral acquisition channels
like content marketing and virality give you very little control over who your customers
share your product with, or who will read your content.

In general, channels with high targetability make it easier to reach very specific
audiences—a priority for companies selling niche products. For companies with larger
markets, like DoorDash, targetability may not be as big of a priority when evaluating
different acquisition channels.

That said, even with high targetability, channel efficacy varies based on who your
audience is and the specific channel being used.

Consider Facebook ads and LinkedIn ads. As paid acquisition channels, they offer
greater targetability than content and viral acquisition methods—but their scope of
targeting differs.

● With Facebook ads, you can target users based on job title. However, since
people use Facebook casually, many don’t actually add their employer or
company info to their profile—making this targeting inaccurate.
● Because of LinkedIn’s purpose as a job platform, people reliably update work
details on their profile. As a result, businesses that want to target based on
profession (e.g., B2B companies like Otter.ai) will find LinkedIn ads more
effective than Facebook ads at reaching their ideal audience.
The point here: Since targeting options can vary even across high-targetability
channels, you must evaluate each channel’s targetability in relation to your specific
market.

Intent
Your target audience may be active on a particular channel (high scale) that also allows
very granular targeting (high targetability). But if their intent in using a channel doesn’t
align with your product, they’re less likely to become a customer.

People browse channels with different goals—we call this intent. For instance, people
tend to use Facebook for updates about their friends but use LinkedIn for professional
networking.

Some channels aren’t as effective for acquiring customers because users aren’t actively
interested in shopping on it. This ultimately depends on who your target audience is and
what you’re selling.

Consider Pinterest. According to Pinterest Trends, some of the most popular keywords
searched revolve around outfit ideas, recipes, and home DIY projects. Users often
browse Pinterest with the goal of sourcing style ideas and inspiration.

Given this intent, running Pinterest ads doesn’t make sense for Otter.ai or DoorDash.
But for Rareform, the intent behind using Pinterest aligns. Why?

● Otter.ai: Users don’t usually browse Pinterest looking for ways to improve their
remote work communication. They’d more likely search on Google for answers to
specific questions like “how to record Google Meet.”
● DoorDash: Even though food is one of Pinterest’s top searched categories, users
are generally looking for specific recipes or cooking tips. They don’t scroll on
Pinterest when they’re hungry and want to order some food.
● Rareform: Since users explore Pinterest for fashion and style inspiration,
Rareform could create ads targeting keywords about eco-friendly fashion.
It’s worth noting, however, that intent can also vary within a single channel. SEO and
search ads are a good example, as not all search queries have high purchase intent.

Someone searching for “best eco-friendly purses” probably has a higher chance of
becoming a Rareform customer (greater purchase intent) than someone Googling “why
is sustainable apparel important?” In this case, searching for information about
sustainable apparel reflects an intent to learn, rather than to buy.

Context
We use context to describe what users are doing on a particular channel or what they
expect to get out of it. When a channel suits your product contextually, it means that
your brand aligns with the channel’s culture, or your product solves a problem relevant
to what’s discussed on that channel.

Context is important not just for judging different channels, but also for evaluating
different strategies within a single channel. It includes factors like:

● Device: Some channels are more commonly viewed on mobile than desktop and
vice versa.
○ Example: Since people typically browse Facebook and Instagram on their
phones, it’s a lot more natural to advertise a mobile app like DoorDash on
these platforms. Using a phone, you can get to the app store and
download DoorDash more quickly and easily than if you saw an ad on
desktop.
● Culture: Some channels have communities with very defined values and
expectations, like Reddit. Or their users lean in a certain direction religiously,
politically, etc.
○ Example: Rareform’s brand focuses on sustainability. With an influencer
marketing strategy, fashion bloggers that thrift clothing and care about the
environment would be a better contextual fit than influencers that clearly
don’t value sustainability, e.g., luxury brand fashion bloggers.
● Relevance: Some channels cover specific topics so if your product or industry
doesn’t fit, audiences may find your content random or out of place.
○ Example: You can pay for a sponsored post on websites like BuzzFeed
and Fast Company. Since BuzzFeed publishes pop culture and
entertainment content, a sponsored post there wouldn’t be a great
contextual fit for a B2B company like Otter.ai. Fast Company is more
relevant since it publishes content about technology and productivity for
business leaders.
Effort
You can think of effort as the amount of time and expertise needed for a channel to
succeed. There are two dimensions to this: setup and maintenance.

Some channels require more initial effort in terms of setup, with compounding results
that require less maintenance later on.

For example, user-generated content strategies often involve more effort in creating
social media campaigns and other marketing collateral to encourage user participation.
But as these strategies gain momentum, companies can repurpose user-created
content rather than producing their own.

Other channels require consistent effort all around, like viral content marketing
strategies. Since creating viral content can’t be automated, companies must continually
work on ideating, creating, and sharing new pieces of content to achieve virality.

Cost
Like effort, the cost of a channel is shaped by two factors: setup and maintenance.
Some channels are costly upfront but after setup, require little in the way of
maintenance.

Take SEO content. You may need to spend a lot of money initially to hire a quality writer
who can do keyword research and create SEO-friendly content. Then you’ll need to
monitor your published content and reoptimize it for better performance—but this
doesn’t require daily maintenance.

Other channels have ongoing maintenance costs in addition to setup. With Facebook
ads, for instance, you need a monthly advertising budget as well as resources for
designing and creating new ads.

Time to results
In an ideal world, whatever growth channel you pick would convert users into customers
immediately—that is, they’d have a short, or fast, time to results.

There’s often a tradeoff between time to results and cost: channels that quickly generate
results (fast time to results) tend to be more expensive than channels that convert
customers over a longer time frame (slow time to results).

Consider the difference between ad networks and content marketing. Creating great
ads and content both take time. However, your ads reach viewers immediately once you
pay Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. On the other hand, any content you publish may
not get many (or any) views for a while—especially for new websites just developing an
SEO foothold. Instead, results build over time, as you develop a loyal readership or
following.

Differences in time to results don’t make one channel more or less effective than
another. However, it’s important to consider this criterion if your company faces more
pressure to acquire customers asap.

How to prioritize different channels
In an ideal world, you’d grow your company through channels that:

● Are used by all of your target audience (high scale)
● Allow you to hone in on your exact audience (high targetability)
● Users browse with a buying mentality (high intent)
● Match your product contextually (high context)
● Require little time and expertise (low effort)
● Are cheap to set up and run (low cost)
● Convert users into customers very quickly (fast time to results)
But channels likely won’t perfectly fit this mold. Some might have more obvious potential
for acquiring customers. Others might “tie” across different criteria, in which case it may
be hard to determine which to prioritize.

For example, imagine you’ve evaluated two channels, Channel A and Channel B. They
score very similarly in terms of targetability, effort, cost, and time to results. However,
Channel A aligns with your product more in terms of context and intent while Channel B
has greater scale.

Channel A
● Low scale
● High intent
● High context
Channel B
● High scale
● Medium intent
● Poor context
In situations like this, we recommend prioritizing channels with stronger contextual fit
and intent—or in this case, Channel A.

Why? Remember our Five Fits Framework: aligning in context and intent is necessary
for achieving market-channel and product-channel fit. It’s much harder to succeed on
channels with poor context and intent because users aren’t in the right mindset to buy
your product.

Think of how people sell water bottles and band merchandise at music festivals. It’s a
lot easier to make these sales versus selling something like books, furniture, or
software, where neither context nor intent fits.

So starting with channels with strong contextual fit and high intent tends to get you the
highest ROI at first—you’re effectively picking the low-hanging fruit before moving up
the tree.

Evaluating strategies within a single
channel
The evaluation framework isn’t only useful for judging and prioritizing different channels.
It also helps when prioritizing strategies within a single channel. Once again, context
and intent should take precedence over the other criteria.

Here’s an example of how that might look in practice.

Imagine your company has decided on pursuing SEO content to acquire customers and
is now debating between a few strategies. One strategy is publishing high-level blog
posts related to your product and industry to generate brand awareness (top-of-funnel
content). Another is creating more specific content, like product comparisons with your
competitors, to convert readers into customers (bottom-of-funnel content).

You could apply the evaluation framework like so:

Top-of-funnel content Bottom-of-funnel content
Scale High: Broad keyword phrases with
high search volume (lots of searches
by more users)
Low: Niche keyword phrases with
low search volume (a small
amount of searches by fewer
users)
Targetabil
ity
Low: Many people search for these
phrases, not only your ideal
customers
High: Your target customers are
more likely to search these niche
keywords than the general public
Intent Low: Less intent to buy your
product—users may not be aware of
it and are more interested in a
broader topic related to it
High: Stronger intent to buy your
product—users are already
familiar with it and want to
compare it with competitors
Context Low: Contextual fit isn’t guaranteed
among all readers, as some users
may have other reasons for
High: Greater contextual fit for
conversions—users are more
than likely looking for product
searching this topic (desire to learn,
research for a project, etc.)
comparisons because they’re
thinking of buying
Effort Medium: Easier to create content
about more general topics that have
lots of existing research
High: More effort required, since
the content creator needs to
research other products
Cost Medium: Cheaper to find qualified
writers. However, you may need to
invest more resources in off-page
SEO because of keyword
competition.
High: Expensive because more
research and product expertise is
needed to create quality content
Time to
results
Slow: Because keywords are more
competitive, ranking highly may take
a longer amount of time, especially if
you don’t invest in off-page SEO
Moderate: Because fewer sites
are competing for the same
keywords, ranking highly may
take a shorter amount of time
Based on this evaluation, you might conclude that bottom-of-funnel content has greater
ROI for your company. Even though it costs more to produce and there are fewer users
searching for this type of content, its alignment in both context and intent means users
consuming bottom-of-funnel content are more likely to convert into paying customers.
So you’d prioritize creating bottom-of-funnel content first, and then move on to
top-of-funnel content later.

In short, our evaluation framework is helpful for not only determining which acquisition
channels to prioritize but also which channel-specific strategies you should start with.
Use the criteria we’ve outlined above to figure out how best to reach your target
audience and what kind of creatives, messaging, etc. might resonate best.

Pick Your Primary Acquisition Channel
The purpose of this section is to provide insight into each acquisition channel. We'll
highlight each channel's scale, targetability, amount of effort required, time to results,
user intent level, and minimum achievable cost to acquire a customer, as well as the

business types it works for. Because context varies based on what you sell, we haven't
included this factor.

We recommend bookmarking this page. Even though you’ll focus on one acquisition
channel at this stage, it’s helpful to have a bird’s-eye view of the full spectrum of ways to
reach new customers. You can refer back to this page whenever you need a quick
refresher on specific channels and their pros and cons.

Right after this section, you'll go through a project in which you'll use this information to
craft your growth strategy and develop a prioritized roadmap of channels to test.

Note: The minimum cost of acquiring a customer is based on our experience. The
prices associated with your industry or country may vary. Use the costs we list as a
benchmark when assessing which channel is best for your startup.

Online Paid Marketing Channels
Google Search ads
Scale: High; able to reach billions of people using Google for searches each day.
However, scale will depend on search volume for relevant keywords.

Targetability: Great; with keyword targeting, you choose the specific search queries
you want your ads to show up for.

Effort: Low; compared to more visual ad channels like Facebook and YouTube, the
time to get up and running is very low since your ads are just text. Most of the effort
comes from thorough keyword research.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: High; people are actively searching for things to buy and researching/comparing
products.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC) : $50

Businesses it works for:

● Products with substantial search volume
● Products that have moderately high LTVs (lifetime value) or average order values
(a $10 product is going to struggle to be profitable)
Google Display ads
Scale: High; over two million websites, videos, and apps show ads using the Google
Display Network.

Targetability: Medium; you target based on keywords, topics, and specific placements,
as well as audiences (retargeting and lookalikes included).

Effort: Medium; Google Display ads require you to write ad copy and create a lot of
different ad creatives. To fully control how your ads look, you need to make ad creatives
in about 30 different sizes. But you can opt for an auto-placement option if you're less
picky about how your creatives display.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: Low; generally speaking, no one likes banner ads. People often ignore them,
and ad blockers block them. The ad is a distraction from the content they're viewing.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC) : $75

Businesses it works for:

● Mobile apps
● Ecommerce
● B2B SaaS
● Visually appealing products
● Products that are easy to identify visually
Google Shopping ads

However, scale will depend on search volume for relevant keywords.

Targetability: Medium; all you have is automated keyword targeting based on your
product's name and product page description.

Effort: Very low; because targeting is automated, the main effort involves selecting
negative keywords and tweaking the product name and description. There are no
assets or ad copy to create, either.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: High; people are actively searching for things to buy and researching/comparing
products.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC) : $35

Amazon ads
Scale: High; able to reach hundreds of millions of people using Amazon for searches
each month. However, scale will depend on search volume on relevant keywords.

Targetability: Great; you can choose one of the various automated keyword targeting
options or manual keyword targeting.

Effort: Low; compared to more visual ad channels like Facebook and YouTube, the
time to get up and running is very low since there's basically no ad copy or creative.
Most of the effort comes from thorough keyword research (but you can also choose
automated targeting options).

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: High; people are actively searching for things to buy and researching/comparing
products.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC) : $25

Businesses it works for:

● Consumer products sold on Amazon
● Products with a very short sales cycle
● Products people are searching for
● Products that are visually appealing
Instagram ads
Scale: High; able to reach hundreds of millions of people using Instagram every day.

Targetability: Great; you have a wide variety of targeting options including
demographics and likes, as well as lookalikes and retargeting options.

Effort: Medium; Instagram is a visual channel. This makes creating ad copy easy, but
high-quality and frequently changing ad creatives are essential, which can be time
consuming.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: Medium; people aren't using Instagram specifically to buy products. But it's a
platform that people browse to keep a pulse on what's new.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC) : $30

Businesses it works for:

Most businesses, including:

● Mobile apps
● Ecommerce (it's a visual platform)
● B2C software
● B2B software
● B2B products with high customer lifetime value
● Products that are visually appealing
Facebook ads
Scale: High; able to reach hundreds of millions of people using Facebook every day
(although on desktop, a portion of users have ad blockers enabled).

Targetability: Great; you have a wide variety of targeting options including
demographics and likes, as well as lookalikes and retargeting options.

Effort: Medium; Facebook is both a written and visual channel. You need to constantly
be creating new ad copy variations and high-quality ad creatives, which can be time
consuming.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: Medium; people aren't on Facebook to buy products, but it is a platform that
people browse to keep a pulse on what's new.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC) : $30

Businesses it works for:

Most businesses, including:

● Mobile apps
● Ecommerce (it's a visual platform)
● B2C software

Quora ads
Scale: Medium; Quora has 300 million monthly active users, which is large but isn't as
big as Facebook and Google.

Targetability: Medium; you target based on keywords and topics, but you can't get
granular.

Effort: Medium; Quora has reduced targeting options, but just like Facebook, you have
to create ad copy and creatives.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: Low; people aren't on Quora to buy products or keep a pulse on what's new, so
purchase intent is low.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC) : $25

Businesses it works for:

● Products that solve a problem people search Quora for
● Professional services
App Store ads
Scale: Medium; Apple has millions of users, but searching for apps is not a frequent
occurrence.

Targetability: Medium; like Google Search, you target based on keywords, but the App
Store is more limited in terms of keyword types and research/volume.

Effort: Low; there's no ad copy or creative involved, just your search listing, so it's quick
to launch.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: High; people are actively looking for an app to download.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC) : $10

Businesses it works for:

● iOS and iPadOS apps
● MacOS apps
Pinterest ads
Scale: Medium; Pinterest has 478 million monthly active users.

Targetability: Medium; you target in similar ways to Facebook, including keywords,
demographics, placements, and audiences (with actalikes and retargeting).

Effort: Medium; like Instagram, you'll need to constantly refresh ad creatives to
experiment and stay fresh. The size formats are also different from all other channels.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: Medium; people often use Pinterest to find new products. Clothing and furniture
products do exceptionally well.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $40

Businesses it works for:

● Ecommerce
● Cooking, health, fashion, furniture, gardening products
Snapchat ads
Scale: High; Snapchat has 290 million daily active users worldwide

Targetability: Medium; you target in similar ways to Facebook, e.g., demographics and
audiences (including actalikes and retargeting).

Effort: Medium; like Instagram and Pinterest, you'll need to constantly refresh ad
creatives to experiment. The size formats are also different, and video is often needed,
so they require customization.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: Low; ads are a distraction from use of the platform, and most people using
Snapchat are young with low buying power.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $40

Businesses it works for:

● B2C mobile apps
● Ecommerce
● Physical locations
● Those that target Gen Z
TikTok ads
Scale: High; TikTok reached 1 billion active users in 2021.

Targetability: Medium; you target in similar ways to Facebook, e.g., demographics,
psychographics/interests, as well as behavior-based targeting.

Effort: Medium; content is king when it comes to TikTok. And like all social ad channels,
you'll need to continually develop new ads in order to experiment as well as avoid
saturating your audience with the same creative.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days. Note: if
you're pursuing an influencer/UGC strategy, there will be more upfront work to reach out
and form those collaborations.

Intent: Low-Medium; TikTok users are still getting used to seeing ads on the app. A
large portion of their user base is also younger folks with generally lower buying power.

However, if you're able to collaborate with influencers (our most-recommended
strategy), buying intent can be decent as you're able to leverage the trust they've built
with their followers.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $40

Businesses it works for:

● Mobile apps
● Ecommerce/DTC brands
YouTube ads
Scale: High; YouTube has two billion monthly active users.

Targetability: Medium; you target similarly to Google Display ads, including keywords,
topics, placements, demographics, and audiences (with lookalikes and retargeting).

Effort: Medium; like Instagram, you need to constantly refresh ad creatives to
experiment. And videos can be expensive and difficult to make.

Time to results: Medium; making high-quality videos takes time—although it's quick if
you already have videos made.

Intent: Low; ads distract people from using YouTube to watch entertaining videos or
learn things. Many people complain about them.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $45

Businesses it works for:

● Ecommerce (gaming, fitness, music, beauty)
● B2B SaaS with high lifetime value
● Visually appealing products
● Mass-market consumer products
Bing ads
Scale: Low; Bing has about 1-2% of Google's daily search volume.

Targetability: Great; Bing's targeting is almost identical to Google Search ads.

Effort: Low; like Google Search, there are no ad creatives to make. You can get Bing to
fully mirror your Google Search ads account.

Time to results: Fast; setting up a Bing account and mirroring/copying over your
Google Search ads takes no time at all.

Intent: High; people are actively searching for things to buy and researching/comparing
products.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $35

Businesses it works for:

● B2B SaaS that targets Microsoft users, since it's the default search engine for
their browsers
● Products that people search for
● Products that solve a problem people search for on Bing
● Products that target older demographics, predominantly women
LinkedIn ads
Scale: Medium; LinkedIn has around 300 million monthly active users.

Targetability: Great; LinkedIn lets you target based on job experience, job titles,
specific companies, and audiences. It has the best data for anything related to work
experience.

Effort: Medium; to do LinkedIn right, you need to write direct messages and ad copy,
build ad creatives, and possibly even create a lead gen asset like an ebook or piece of
content.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: Low; people don't tend to use LinkedIn to find products to buy. Instead, they use
it to hire people, get hired, or sell products.

Average cost per LEAD (CPL): $200. Note that for LinkedIn, we use CPL instead of
CAC. The focus here is on getting valid email addresses, not acquiring customers yet.
Actual customer conversion often requires moving over to a different channel, such as
direct sales. LinkedIn is expensive and tends to work only for B2B companies earning
thousands in customer LTV.

Businesses it works for:

● Recruiting
● Higher education
● B2B businesses with a customer lifetime value of over $1,500
Twitter ads
Scale: Medium; Twitter has around 206 million monthly active users.

Targetability: Medium; Twitter lets you target based on demographics and audience,
which includes keyword, interest, and topic-based targeting.

Effort: Medium; like Facebook, Twitter is a written and visual channel. You need to
create engaging ad copy variations and creatives, which can be time consuming.

Time to results: Fast; you can go from zero to results in a matter of days.

Intent: Low; people don’t browse Twitter to shop. They use it to stay up-to-date with
current events in different niches.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $45

Businesses it works for:

● Mobile apps or companies with optimized mobile funnels
● Products with moderately high LTV/ARPU
● Companies looking to amplify content
Affiliate & influencer marketing
This is when you contact people with their own audiences (on social media platforms or
on their own) and incentivize them to plug your product, either blatantly or covertly.

Scale: Medium; there are influencers with followings of all sizes on different platforms,
with many hundreds of millions of followers and subscribers collectively. Your scale will
depend on how many influencers there are in your niche, and how popular they are.

Targetability: Medium; you can select influencers whose audiences directly overlap
with your company's. For example, if you have a personal finance app, you can target
personal finance bloggers and YouTubers.

Effort: Medium; you need to create a list of influencers, contact them, educate them on
your product, negotiate rates, and work with them on how to naturally pitch your
product.

Time to results: Medium; it can take about 15 hours a week to build an influencer
marketing program, including contacting and negotiating with influencers.

Intent: Medium; some influencers' followers respect their recommendations, but they
often don't follow with an intent to purchase products.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $30 (but you can often negotiate deals
such as a percentage of sales or flat-fee promotions)

Businesses it works for:

● Ecommerce (especially health, beauty, and apparel)
● Consumer SaaS
● Industries/niches where influencers dominate and their fans respect what they
have to say
Offline paid acquisition channels
These channels include classics like billboards, pamphlets in mailboxes, and TV and
print ads. We don't cover how to execute these channels, but below is a quick overview
of what they are and how to evaluate them. They're generally rather simple: Create a
compelling, unique ad, and then negotiate to have it distributed (and pay lots of money).

Direct mail
Scale: High; you can send direct mail to basically anyone with an address.

Targetability: Medium; you can choose the neighborhoods you want to send to. For
example, one company sent mail to people within a few miles of a hospital that was
advertising open nurse positions.

Effort: Low; the main efforts are designing the pamphlet you're sending out and
choosing where to send it. Delivery services are quite easy to use for that.

Time to results: Medium; once you finally launch, results are pretty quick, but first you
need to design the pamphlets, print them, and get the delivery service to pick them up
and deliver them (probably a day or several later).

Intent: Very low; people's default reaction to random fliers in the mail is to toss them
immediately. You need to really grab their attention. Even when you do, this channel is
higher friction because they then have to visit a website, make a phone call, or go to a
store.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $50. Besides upfront printing costs, you
have delivery costs and any promotional value you offer (which helps you track
performance).

Businesses it works for:

● Local businesses
● Food and delivery services
● Real estate services
Physical advertisements
Scale: High; you could theoretically buy any billboard or subway, bus, or bus stop ad in
the world if you outbid everybody else.

Targetability: Poor; availability depending, you can choose the specific places you
want to advertise to, but you can't control who looks at your ad.

Effort: High; there's no easy platform for buying physical advertisement placements. It's
still a very manual process of calling different companies.

Time to results: Slow; because physical advertisements are mostly good for general
brand awareness, it takes time to have a measurable effect.

Intent: Low; people aren't wondering which website-building tool to use when they're
heading to a coffee shop or commuting.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $???. It's very hard to track, other than
hand-wavy things like, "At this date, we added a billboard in this area, and sales there
increased by X% over the next Y months."

Businesses it works for:

● Local businesses
● Companies that want brand awareness, particularly in a location where their
target market is (like Silicon Valley having tons of tech billboards)
● Real estate services
TV/print/radio ads
Image source: https://www.creativereview.co.uk/mcdonalds-canada-ads-moving-day/
Scale: High; you can blast your ads on every TV channel and radio station and in every newspaper
and magazine.
Targetability: Poor; you can choose the specific channels, stations, or magazines to
target, but you're at the whim of their audiences.

Effort: High; there's no easy platform for buying these ads. It's still a very manual
process of calling different companies.

Time to results: Slow; because these ads are mostly good for general brand
awareness, it takes time to have a measurable effect.

Intent: Low; ads are an unwelcome distraction.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC) : $???. It's very hard to track, besides
hand-wavy things like, "At this date, we added a billboard in this area, and sales there
increased by X% over the next Y months."

Businesses it works for:

● Companies that want brand awareness
● Expensive, luxury products (e.g., Rolex)
● Products that appeal to almost everyone (e.g., Febreze)
● Companies with very large budgets
Content acquisition channels
These are channels for which people create content, either written or video, to increase
traffic and build affinity with their audience.

Search engine optimization
This is content written specifically to target high-volume, preferably low-difficulty
keywords that people use to search on Google. The goal is to write the definitive article

that answers a user's query/solves their problem, increasing traffic to the article and
improving the rank of your site overall.

Scale: High; there are billions of Google and Bing searches every day.

Targetability: Medium; you can target specific keywords, but you're at the whim of the
search engine's algorithm.

Effort: Medium; to be clear, it takes time to write and edit a lot of articles targeting
various keywords, although you can easily outsource them to writers.

Time to results: Slow; at a minimum, it takes several months to start seeing results.
And it can take over a year to start seeing meaningful volume—if it comes at all.

Intent: Medium; depending on the keyword you target, you could have anything from
very high to very low intent.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $0. If you write all the articles yourself,
you can get organic customers "for free." But realistically, you'll want to outsource the
writing.

Businesses it works for:

● Companies in niches that have significant search volume
● Products that require extensive education before the audience understands what
they are and why they're needed
● Professional services, such as accountants, agencies, and law firms, as they can
demonstrate their expertise
User-generated content
This is content created by your user base, not by you. Obvious examples are social
media platforms. People put videos on YouTube, and those videos bring people to
YouTube. This also includes platforms like Medium and Substack, as well as
marketplaces like Airbnb and Etsy (seen above).

Scale: High; if you have a lot of users and they're incentivized to generate content,
there's no limit to your reach (think Facebook, Medium, or Substack).

Targetability: Poor; you have little to no control over the content your users make.

Effort: Medium; it can be challenging to create a platform that encourages and
incentivizes users to generate a lot of good content and share it. On the other hand, you
aren't creating the content yourself.

Time to results: Slow; you need to reach a decent size before the amount of content
being produced by users is sufficient to generate results.

Intent: Medium; ultimately, intent depends on the content your users generate, so it can
range from very low to very high.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $0. Because your users are generating
the content, it doesn't cost you anything.

Businesses it works for:

● Social networks including Facebook, Twitter, and Dribbble
● Tools that help people create and distribute content. Examples: Medium and
Substack
● B2C media businesses
● Marketplace businesses (think Airbnb or Etsy)
Viral content
This is content made to be shared. That means it's either extremely shareable/viral in
nature—like a funny meme—OR it's so good and useful that people naturally want to
share it with others and link to it from their site. Demand Curve's playbooks are viral
content. They're not made with SEO in mind. They're purely meant to be extremely
detailed and useful content that people will want to reference and share with others.

Scale: High; there's no limit to the amount of content you can create for this purpose,
and no limit to the number of people who might see it.

Targetability: Poor; you can choose the subject for the content, which will influence
who ends up reading and liking it, and you can share the content in various places
(social media, Reddit, Product Hunt, etc.) to distribute it to specific types of people. You
can also run ads to it if it tends to perform well. But you can't control who shares it and
when.

Effort: High; viral content requires a lot of writing, researching, planning, and
experimentation. Hitting virality through some sort of weird novelty way takes a good
deal of experimentation. If you want your content shared because it's really good, it
takes substantial effort to make it really good.

Time to results: Slow-medium; writing and creating really great content takes time and
effort, but each piece lets you get the ball rolling.

Intent: Low; generally, readers of viral content don't have high intent to purchase
anything.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $0. Each additional user doesn't directly
cost you anything, particularly if you're writing all the content yourself. But to create
great content, you probably need to hire great writers.

Businesses it works for:

● Teams with strong content expertise
● Educational products (like Demand Curve; content reflects product)
Organic social media
Organic social can play a variety of roles. In the early days, simply setting up 1-2 social
media accounts tells the world that you're a real, active company. At the very least, it
instills a bit of trust when your first prospects are considering doing business with you.
For startups just getting started, especially those with limited budgets, organic social
can serve as a way to start getting a trickle of traffic onto your site. It won't be much at
first, but it costs nothing but time.

As you gain traction, your focus on social will really come down to which scalable
growth lane you hone in on. If the content marketing lane is your priority, social can play
a key role in the amplification of your content (especially for those taking a viral content
and/or UGC content approach). But for those tackling all other growth lanes, social will
likely not play a big role. At least for a while - for example, until you begin to prioritize
initiatives such as community building where social may be a big factor.

Probably the best advice we can give when it comes to organic social: If you're going to
prioritize it, know exactly why. Don't invest in social simply because "everyone else
seems to be." If it serves a key function in your growth function, perfect, double down on
it. If not, prioritize your real growth drivers.

Later in the program we'll show you how to execute a conversion-driven Instagram
strategy. We'll also show you how to build an engaged following with LinkedIn Organic.

Scale : Medium-high; when social media works, it really works. But it takes a long time
to build a sizable audience of engaged followers.

Targeting : Poor; on most social media channels, targeting is determined by things like
number of connections or audience size, platform engagement, post content, and post
quality. In order to reach your target customers, produce the type of content you think
would resonate, and do it consistently over a long period of time.

Effort : Medium - high; success on social media is typically a function of consistently
publishing quality content over a long period of time. Visual platforms like Instagram
take more effort to get right. Whereas LinkedIn, which rewards well-structured and
engaging text-based content, requires less effort per post, but more patience to get
results.

Time to results : Medium; Organic social takes time to really "work," which is why we
recommend pairing it with channels with faster output cycles to start. Setting up a
minimum viable profile on at least one social channel helps establish credibility. Results
will be small early on, but after about 6 months of following our playbooks, you can
expect to have a sizable audience to market to.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC) : $0. If you do it yourself, it's free. If you
hire content creators, you might spend several hundred dollars per month for a few
posts per week.

Businesses it works for : Most businesses, including:

● Mobile apps
● Ecommerce (it's a visual platform)
● B2C software
● B2B software
● B2B products with high customer lifetime value
● Products that are visually appealing
Viral acquisition channels
Word-of-mouth virality
The most well-known (and sought-after) form of product virality. Your customers talk
about your company with their friends, family, and co-workers simply because they love
what you do. Not because they've been incentivized. Not because they get anything out
of it. You've created such a delightful experience they just can't keep it to themselves.

Scale: High; if you can get more than just a small but vocal subset of customers to
spread the word, the scale of word-of-mouth really knows no bounds.

Targetability: Poor; you're at the mercy of your customers and who they choose to talk
about you with.

Effort: Low; aside from all the sweat and tears you've poured into making such a
fantastic product and customer experience :)

Time to results: Slow; it's worth clarifying -- as with all forms of product virality -- that
you will start to get initial results quickly. But the volume will be low in the early days.
Product virality is a long-term investment as it takes years to amass a sizeable
customer base for virality to really kick into high gear.

Intent: Medium; people tend to share products not only because they love the product,
but also because they want to be helpful and think their friend would also get value from
it. In a way, they are acting like an advertising channel - trying to target those they feel
could also be a fit for your offering.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $0.

Businesses it works for: Simple, affordable (read: free) products that appeal to the
masses.

Pull virality
This is when customers naturally recommend your product to others so they can get
more out of it. A classic example is Dropbox. Dropbox users benefit when others use
Dropbox, so they'll pitch Dropbox to anyone they need to share files with.

Scale: High; this is a snowball effect. The more customers you have, the more free
advertising you get. The effects are barely noticeable at small scale, but are huge at
scale.

Targetability: Poor; you're completely at the whim of whoever happens to see people
using the product.

Effort: Low; the main effort is making a product people like to use regularly, then
designing it to stand out or be instantly recognizable. Everyone knows what a
Lamborghini looks like, and it gets a lot of attention.

Time to results: Slow; it's worth clarifying -- as with all forms of product virality -- that
you will start to get initial results quickly. But the volume will be low in the early days.

Product virality is a long-term investment as it takes years to amass a sizeable
customer base for virality to really kick into high gear.

Intent: High; often, a current user is recommending that someone use your product
because it solves a problem one or both of them are facing.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $0. There's no cost for people to
recommend a product to others, unless you incentivize it.

Businesses it works for:

● Products that get better the more people are using them, such as marketplaces,
social apps, and networks
Incentivized virality
Incentivized virality is a hybrid between paid acquisition and viral acquisition. You
incentivize your customers to invite others to use the product by offering the referrer
and/or referee some sort of bonus. This can be straight cash, but more often it's free
credits or additional features/bonuses in the product itself.

Scale: High; this is a snowball effect. The more customers you have, the more potential
referrers you have.

Targetability: Low; you're at the whim of the customers recommending your product.

Effort: Medium; it takes a decent amount of effort to dial in a referral program (when to
ask for referrals, how to ask, how much to offer, etc.), but once it's running, it's pretty
easy.

Time to results: Slow; it's worth clarifying -- as with all forms of product virality -- that
you will start to get initial results quickly. But the volume will be low in the early days.
Product virality is a long-term investment as it takes years to amass a sizeable
customer base for virality to really kick into high gear.

Intent: Low; because you're incentivizing people, they're probably going to share the
referral link with a lot of people, many of whom don't actually care about the product.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $20. It all depends on how much you offer
as an incentive. If you offer a discount on a piece of software, it doesn't really cost you
anything. If you offer cash or a discount on a physical product, it costs you something.

Businesses it works for:

● Products that get better the more people are using them, such as marketplaces,
social apps, and networks. Incentivized virality helps to amplify pull virality (as
well as natural word-of-mouth virality).
● Products that aren't particularly private in nature. People may be less likely to
broadly share their referral link for a dating app, for example.
● Products people love and would be happy to share with others.
Push virality
This is when customers end up advertising your product just by using it. Examples
include Uber and Superhuman (a Superhuman email signature is always included). You
could also argue that this applies to physical products like iPhones and fancy cars.

Scale: High; this is a snowball effect. The more customers you have, the more free
advertising you get. Its effects are barely noticeable at small scale, but they're huge at
scale.

Targetability: Low; you're completely at the whim of whoever happens to see people
using the product.

Effort: Low; the main effort is making a product people like to use regularly, then
designing it to stand out or be instantly recognizable. Everyone knows what a
Lamborghini looks like, and they get a lot of attention.

Time to results: Slow; it's worth clarifying -- as with all forms of product virality -- that
you will start to get initial results quickly. But the volume will be low in the early days.
Product virality is a long-term investment as it takes years to amass a sizeable
customer base for virality to really kick into high gear.

Intent: Low; because people are seeing the product out in the wild at random times, it's
generally when they have zero intent to purchase it—but not always. Sometimes, it will
be the perfect moment.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $0. Besides the upfront cost to make a
branded or beautiful product, there's no cost for people to see others using it.

Businesses it works for:

● Physical products that are used in public and easily recognizable
● Software products that people use to interact with others
Sales acquisition channels
Cold outreach
Scale: High; the only limits to scale are the size of your market and your ability to get
contact information.

Targetability: High; you can specifically select the people you'd like to contact.

Effort: High; although much of the outreach can be automated, it takes a lot of writing
and rewriting emails, then nurturing leads after they respond.

Time to results: Fast; you can start sending emails in a matter of hours.

Intent: Low; this is cold outreach. It's unlikely that recipients had any intent to purchase
a product like yours.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $0. If you do it yourself, it's free to
prospect and send emails to people. If you hire salespeople or use prospecting tools, it
can be costly.

Businesses it works for:

● B2B products
● Service-based businesses
● B2C products with a customer lifetime value of more than $150
Unscalable acquisition channels
Super-node websites (Product Hunt, Reddit, Hacker
News)
This is when you launch your product on websites like Product Hunt, Reddit, Hacker
News, Designer News, Indie Hackers, and various other communities. They generally
rank for only a day, and you typically need to promote the post in other places to get
significant traction.

This channel tends to do best if a superuser of the platform is the one to share your
product, not you.

Later in the program, we'll show you exactly how to launch a product on Product Hunt in
step-by-step fashion.

Scale: Low; although there are a lot of people using these channels, ranking can be
very difficult. Even if you do, your content is really only going to rank for a day or so.
You'll get a great burst to launch something, but it's not scalable.

Targetability: Poor; there's no targeting on many of these sites—besides maybe
Reddit, where you can target based on the subreddit you choose. Ultimately, the
audience is whoever uses the site that day and whom you're able to market your post
to.

Effort: Medium; it doesn't necessarily take a lot of work to create the post, video, some
images, or a bit of text, but it takes a decent amount of work to cross-promote it and try
to engineer it to be viral.

Time to results: Fast; things generally rank and get traffic for a maximum of 24 hours,
so it's a very fast turnaround.

Intent: Low; people use Product Hunt and these other sites to find cool new tools and
products, but generally just free ones. They're bombarded with them all day, so there's
some fatigue.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $0. It doesn't cost anything to post to or
use these sites. It would only cost money if you were to pay for a video or a designer.

Businesses it works for:

● SaaS tools for B2B or B2C
● Bundles of free tools and content
● Weird viral things
Off-line meetup or conference sponsorship
This channel could entail either hosting your own conference or meetup, or going to
others as an attendee or with your own booth.

Scale: Low; there are only so many conferences and meetups. If you're running one, it's
very costly and time consuming.

Targetability: High; you can cherry-pick very specific conferences to go to (or run). For
example, people at the bitcoin conference are perfect if you have a bitcoin-related
product.

Effort: Medium-high; if you're creating a conference, it's a ton of work. Running a booth,
a lot of work. Going to a conference to network, not a ton.

Time to results: Medium; if you're just attending, results can be fast. If you're running a
conference or managing a booth, there are weeks to months to years of planning and
organization.

Intent: Medium; people going to conferences are often looking for products and
services to use.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $250. The cost depends on whether
you're just buying a ticket, running a booth, or hosting a conference.

Businesses it works for:

● B2B products targeting enterprise customers
● B2C products with high lifetime value per customer
Tapping existing audiences
This channel entails a combination of paid and organic tactics that let you leverage
existing audiences to acquire your best customers. This includes everything from
tapping your personal network to guest posting to attending in-person events and more.

Scale : Low; in most cases, the tactics in this channel will only work once (e.g.,in-person
events or negotiating the details of a one-time newsletter placement).

Targeting : High; by nature, this channel involves going after your exact audience
wherever they happen to be. The whole point is to find out where your target market
spends time online and offline and use the tactics we teach to market to them
effectively.

Effort : Medium; If you don't have a budget, you'll need to put in the time and effort to
create content and execute cold outreach on a 1-to-1 or 1-to-many scale. On the flip
side, if you have some budget available, the process will be a lot faster (e.g., buying
sponsored content placements directly).

Time to results : Fast; generally, people will either convert right away or not at all,
whether that's signing up for your product through a newsletter plug or buying through a
sponsored ad or piece of content.

Intent : Medium; depending on the audience and platform context, the intent could be
very high (people reading a product comparison article) or low (people attending
in-person Meetup groups and socializing in online communities).

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC) : $0; The cost depends on whether you're
using paid or organic tactics. If paid, you'll have to pay to sponsor your content (podcast
ad, newsletter placement, sponsored blog post).

Businesses it works for : Considering the scope and nature of this strategy, tapping
existing audiences works for every business type.

Speaking engagements
These are conferences or other events where you can offer your services as a
presenter on a topic directly related to your business. Unless you're a high-ticket
person, it's unlikely that you'll be paid; instead, do it for free for the exposure.

Scale: Low; there are only so many places with speaking engagement opportunities.

Targetability: High; you can cherry-pick very specific events where your target
audience will be.

Effort: High; you have to find the event, convince organizers to let you talk, create the
speech, travel to the event, and give the speech.

Time to results: Fast; generally, people will either convert right then and there at the
event, or they won't at all.

Intent: Low; the audience is most likely looking to learn, not purchase a product.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $0. The cost depends on whether you
need to pay to attend and/or need to travel.

Businesses it works for:

● B2B products targeting enterprise customers
● B2C products with high lifetime value per customer
PR (public relations)
PR involves creating some sort of story or buzz. Different media outlets then decide to
share the story. In the tech industry, TechCrunch is the classic media outlet that covers
the stories of hot new startups and their funding rounds.

Scale: Low; there are only so many media outlets, and they can only cover you so
many times.

Targetability: Low; you can choose the media outlet, which may have an audience type
(like tech people and TechCrunch), but anyone can see it.

Effort: Low-medium; you might have to come up with the story, write the articles
yourself, and do a lot of schmoozing with editors/writers. If you have connections
already, it's pretty easy.

Time to results: Fast; if you have the connections at media outlets, the turnaround time
is very fast. PR leads to spikes in traffic that die off quickly.

Intent: Low; the audience is just reading the news. They aren't looking to buy products.

Average customer acquisition cost (CAC): $0. The cost really depends on whether or
not you have connections at media outlets. If you don't, you'll probably need a PR
agency, which will charge large amounts of money to be the gatekeeper to the media
outlets.

Businesses it works for:

● Mission-driven companies with a novel or impactful narrative
Introduction: Copywriting
Communication is the most crucial life and business skill.

Writing is the most effective method of communication.

Why?

● It's scalable. Tens of millions of people have read our written content.
● It gives YOU time to think. Writing lets you find the right words to communicate
an idea effectively.
● It gives THEM time to think. Written content can be read, absorbed, and
reacted to.
● It's there forever. Written words can be referenced and re-read infinitely.
Writing is a critical skill for everyone, but...

Writing is particularly important for founders and marketers

Founders and marketers frequently write to convince people of things, such as:

● Sell customers a product,
● Get investors to give them money,
● Negotiate with vendors to lower their price of a product/service,
● Convince rockstars to join the company.
Everything a founder or marketer does, fundamentally, is to convince people to do
things.

Copywriting is the most scalable method to do exactly that.

There's no "surefire" way to teach copywriting
Copywriting is a hybrid between art and soft science.

The soft science comes in due how the words you chose interact with human
psychology. How you say something, where you say it, when you say it, and who you're
saying it to, all combine together in someone's head to elicit a certain reaction.

In general, we all run the same core operating system on the same hardware, and the
best copywriting pushes the write buttons to cause people to react a certain way.

But it's not completely formulaic. There is an element of art to the best copywriting.
Sometimes the best copywriting also seemingly breaks some of the rules.

To learn the art, you need to do two things:

Reading a lot of good and bad writing. Try to determine why something is
good or bad and what it makes you feel.
Writing a lot. That doesn't mean getting AI to write it. It means actually
struggling through it yourself.
Therefore, this chapter is less prescriptive than others
There aren't many good books on writing because of this complex mix of soft science
and art.

It's not like teaching math. There is no prescriptive way of doing it.

So instead of a prescriptive lesson plan, we'll instead have a series of lessons
that illustrate the difference between good and bad writing, and some tips and
tools to be a better writer.

The idea is that you'll walk away a better copywriter in life and in business.

Let's get started.

Fundamental Rules of Good Copy
Harry Dry is my favorite copywriter.

He obsesses over brevity and clarity.

And leverages visuals to enhance both.

Here are Harry’s three fundamental rules
to good copy:
Can you visualize it?
Can you falsify it?
Can nodody else say this?
As Harry says:

“If you have three no’s, you’ve probably written a lot of rubbish. If you have three
yes’s, you’re on to something”

Let’s dive into each.

But first, here’s an ad that does all three:

Rule #1: Can you visualize it?
If they can’t visualize it, they won’t remember it.

The more concrete and specific the visual, the better.

For example, most companies write copy like this:

● Worn by everybody
● Get fit again
● 32GB storage capacity
You can’t visualize the first. The second is ambiguous. The third is too technical.

Here are better examples of each:

● Worn by supermodels in London and dads in Ohio
● Couch to 5K
● 1,000 songs in your pocket
Rule #2: Can you falsify it?
Can your words be proven to be true or false?

This weeds out meaningless copy like this:

● Revolutionize an industry
● Quality you can trust
● Next-generation technology
● World-class service
Seriously, pause for a moment and ask what any of the above actually means in
concrete terms.

They're actually completely meaningless statements.

To avoid this mistake, point to concrete facts and examples. Don’t just describe.

Let’s illustrate with an example:

You’re setting up a date for your best guy friend. Most people say things like:

● Smart
● Funny
● Good values
● Tall and attractive
Those are all subjective descriptions that tell you nothing about him. Give that
description to 10 people, and they'll all picture someone else.

But, instead, if you say:

● Reads every day
● Has made me pee myself laughing
● Volunteers with seniors
● 6’2” and looks like Ryan Gosling
Now they have a real idea of who this person is, what they’d be like to be around, and
whether they might be someone they’d be interested in.

Just like Heinz can prove that people put competitors’ ketchups in Heinz bottles:

Rule #3: Can nobody else say it?
Draw a line in the sand and say something unique to you

That makes someone buy your product instead of your competitors.

For example, in an old print ad, Volvo pointed out that their odometers have more
numbers than everyone else:

Note: Volvo used “speedometer” because “odometer” was an uncommon word at the
time. They define it in the body copy.

Speaking of Volvos, Chevrolet points out that Corvettes are the fuel for countless songs
(unlike basically any other car):

Next time you’re writing copy, pass it
through this test
Can you visualize it?
Can you falsify it?
Can nobody else say this?
Keep rewriting until you get three yeses.

I highly recommend watching the entire interview with Harry Dry on How I Write.

Copywriting Frameworks
The best copywriting taps into deep aspects of our psychology.

Things like:

● Loss Aversion: The pain of losing is significantly more than the pleasure of
gaining.
● Herd Mentality: We copy the behaviour of others, particularly those whom we
respect or are similar to.
● Framing Effect: How information is presented can strongly influence your
perception and response.
And dozens of more psychological biases and tendencies.

Ideally, you get to a point where you effortlessly weave these into your copywriting. But
that can take a lot of reading, writing, and pattern matching.

Instead, we recommend using copywriting frameworks. Think of them as
fill-in-the-blank templates. Templates that were created with these psychological biases
in mind and have been thoroughly battle tested by decades of copywriters.

We'll cover 7 of the most common frameworks.

As a tl;dr, here's a cheatsheet that our founder, Neal O'Grady, created:

PAS(P)
PAS is one of the most commonly used and referenced copywriting frameworks. Now
that you know it, you will probably see it everywhere.

We've added the P (for Proof) as social proof strengthens any message.

Problem : Identify a problem that your audience has.

“Writing is f-ing hard”

Agitation : Make the problem more intense and visceral.

“Selling is even harder.”

Solution : Introduce your product/service as the solution to the problem.

“These frameworks help create compelling copy that sells.”

Proof : Provide evidence & examples that prove your solution works.

“Lil' Bobby increased conversion rates by 23% by switching his sales emails to follow
these frameworks”

BAB
One of the simpler ones, paint the story of where they are, where they could be, and
how they can get there.

Before : Show your reader's current (bad) situation.

"Constantly overwhelmed managing multiple client projects and never-ending tasks?"

After : Show how amazing their life could be.

"Imagine smoothly handling all your projects, and having a clear view of your daily
tasks, boosting your productivity significantly."

Bridge : Explain how your product bridges them from "Before" to "After."

"Our productivity app will take you from overwhelmed to organized. Try it today and
experience the difference."

Storytelling
Stories are extremely powerful ways to communicate complex ideas.

The story of a little girl (Ann Frank) resonates far more than the cold statistics from
World War II.

Here’s a storytelling framework PIXAR uses:

Once upon a time, ___________________.

Every day, ___________________.

Until one day, ___________________.

Because of that, ___________________.

Because of that, ___________________.

Until finally, ___________________.

Example

Once upon a time, Alice, a founder of a creative agency, was on top of the world.

Every day, she'd do sales calls for inbound leads and crush her client work.

Until one day, a recession hit and cut inbound leads by 2/3rds.

Because of that, she needed to increase leads, or else she'd have to lay off staff.

Because of that, Alice started posting on LinkedIn and Twitter. Most of her posts
flopped—but a few did well and brought in leads, but she had a tough time running a
business and creating good content consistently.

Until finally, she joined Unignorable to learn how to systematically create content that
resonates with her audience.

AIDA
This is also quite popular, and it differs from PAS and BAB by having a clear call to
action to finish it off—and you’re not necessarily focusing on a problem.

Attention : Hook their attention with a bold headline, an intriguing question, or a unique
fact.

"Traditional laundry detergents harm the environment."

Interest : Add fuel to the fire. Build interest with a story.

"Our eco-friendly laundry detergent is designed to provide excellent cleaning results
while protecting our planet."

Desire : Amplify desire. Paint a vivid picture of life after using your product/service.

"Imagine having fresh, clean clothes, knowing that you're also doing your part to keep
our air fresh."

Action : Drive to action with a clear & compelling CTA.

"Make the switch today and join us in protecting our environment."

PASTOR
This is PAS’s long-winded cousin.

It also works for multi-email sales campaigns. Each email can focus on each one of
these letters.

Problem : Call out a problem that their facing.

"Frustrated with your slow and unreliable internet connection?"

Amplify : Emphasize the consequences if the problem is not solved.

"In today's work-from-home era, a slow connection can prevent you from doing your
best work—and make a bad first impression with clients."

Solution : Provide your solution to the problem.

"Our high-speed internet service offers a reliable and blazing-fast connection—you'll
never have a laggy video call."

Testimony : Showcase testimonials and case studies to prove that your solution works.

"Don't just take our word for it. One of our customers said, 'Switching to this service has
changed my life. I used to spend 20% of every call repeating things due to my choppy
connection.'"

Offer : Detail what exactly they will get when they purchase the product/service.

"Subscribe to our high-speed internet service today and receive free installation."

Response : Call to action—make it clear what they need to do to take the next step.

"Call us or visit our website to subscribe and say goodbye to slow internet."

The 4 P’s
This one is all about making them picture their improved life and pushing them towards
taking action to achieve it.

Promise : Make a bold promise about what your product/service can do.

"Lose 10 pounds in just 30 days with our proven fitness program."

Picture : Help them visualize their new, improved life.

"Imagine fitting into that old pair of jeans sitting in your closet—and feeling like your old,
confident self again."

Proof : Back up your promise with testimonials/data.

"Sarah, a mother of two rambunctious boys, lost 12 pounds in 30 days and says, 'This
program has given me my confidence back!'"

Push : Give them a reason to take action now.

"Sign up now and start your journey to a healthier, happier you."

PRUNE
A lesser-known one. The use of an analogy makes it rather unique.

Point : Make your point in the first sentence.

“Get around the city effortlessly with our affordable bike-sharing service."

Reason : Back it up with a reason.

"Why rely on crowded public transport or expensive taxis when you can breeze through
the city on a bike, avoiding traffic and saving money?"

Unveil : Present the proof or evidence.

“Our average customer cuts their commute by 7 minutes and saves $152 per year."

Nail : Use an analogy to drive your point home.

"It's like having your own bike, but without the hassle of maintenance or the worry of
theft. Simply pick up a bike when you need it and drop it off when you're done."

Exit : Close with a call to action.

"Ready to make your city travels easier and more fun? Download our app today and
take your first ride!"

How and where to use them
These frameworks can be used in writing projects of all sizes, from short cold emails
and LinkedIn bios, to full-on webpages, email campaigns, and articles.

For webpages, the different sections of the page can map to the different parts of the
framework. Highlight the problem in the hero. Agitate the problem in the next section.
Present the solution in the next. Back it up with social proof in the next.

Although the examples above are presented as single sentences per point, that was
purely done for simplicity. You can go far deeper on each of them.

Process to Generate Copy Ideas
The most important aspect of any copywriting project?

The headline.

Why?

● We skim
● We need to be hooked
● A single punchy line can resonate
Most people jump straight into writing a bunch of headlines.

Worse yet?

A lot of them just roll with the first idea that comes to mind.

Here’s Dan Nelken’s process for generating hundreds of ideas for your next copywriting
project.

Step 1: Create your idea buckets

Instead of jumping into finished headlines, start extremely high level. Create at least 20
idea buckets. As Dan says, you’re on the right track if they're too obvious.

List benefits, attributes, insights, and general truths for whatever you’re selling.

Here’s what this might look like for Udemy:

You can learn from home
You can learn from the comfort of home (slight word change)
You don’t have to go to school
You don’t have to commute
Classes start whenever you want them to
Add new skills to your resume
They offer free courses
Countless 5-star reviews
Students can rate teachers.
Over 40,000 courses to choose from.
And so on.

Notice how high-level and obvious these are. They are just simple truths about the
product and the company. We don't want to be clever at this point. Just painfully
obvious,.

Some tips:

● Just jot them down.
● Make slight wording changes to previous ideas.
● Get more specific with ideas.
● Look at the opposites. "Not slow" may give interesting ideas versus "fast."
● Research product pages, competition, FAQs, socials, and reviews.
Step 2: Fill your buckets with ideas

Let’s dive a little deeper. We’ll jot down ten first-thought ideas for each bucket.

For example, for the bucket “ You can learn from home: ”

Note: This is straight from A Self-Help Guide for Copywriters

Some tips:

● This is a painful process. You’re flushing all the bad ideas out to find gems.
● Resist the urge to write headlines. Just jot down the ideas.
● Look out for relatable truths. Ones that make you say, “That’s so damn true!”
● What’s the benefit of the benefit? Or phrased differently, what are you really
selling? Trampolines are fun for kids but also give parents a break.
Step 3: Craft the ideas into headlines/ads

You want to take your collection of ideas and turn them into clear (or clever) and
compelling headlines.

Unfortunately, this is the trickiest step.

This gets into the entire field of copywriting, which as we said is hard to "just teach." So
this chapter will continue to introduce some methods to create good copy.

10 Ways to Hook People
Note : This is from our founder, Neal O'Grady's, popular article on hooks.

What is a hook?
A hook is the opener of anything you want people to pay attention to.

Whether it’s a:

● Social post
● YouTube video
● Fundraising pitch
● Cold email/DM
● Presentation
Or even a quirky travel story.

People are gone if you don’t intrigue them within a few seconds.

They continue scrolling.

They mentally check out.

Or they mark you as spam.

A hook is the first:

● 1-3 sentences
● The title slide of a presentation
● The first view seconds of a video
Hooks have the power to make or break any piece of
content.
A “meh” piece of content with a WOW hook has a better chance than a WOW piece of content
with a “meh” hook.

This is true whether the post is short-form or long-form. Why invest in a 20-minute article if it
fails to grip you in the intro?

I bet you could rewrite the hooks on all your posts and get upwards of 10x the engagement the
second time.

This lesson will teach you how to write thumb-stopping hooks.

10 fundamental ways to write a hook
I write a newsletter for 102,000 startup founders and have 65,000 followers on LinkedIn.

Naturally, I wanted to reverse engineer what made posts go viral. I started going through the top
posts with 10s and 100s of thousands of likes, and certain patterns emerged.

Here’s what I discovered after a lot of hours and coffee:

Credibility
Fear
Curiosity
Counter-narrative
Eloquence
Faces
Value
Surprise
Celebration
Identity
Let’s go into each of these now with a ton of examples.

1. How to write a hook with Credibility
Telling people WHY they should listen to YOU for this topic.

This isn’t bragging. It’s contextualizing why they should take your advice seriously.

Credibility hook examples

You can write a credibility hook in three different ways:

Your experience and accomplishments
Your effort
Someone else’s credibility
Your experience and accomplishments.

Why should I listen to you?

● “I have an MBA.”
● “I was ranked CEO of the year.”
● “I run two 7-figure startups.”
It feels like bragging, but you should be fine if you do it with humility and without standing in
front of a Lamborghini.

Your effort.

Is this information worth anything?

“Oh damn, Naim spent 16 hours on this?”

This is a result of the Labor Illusion:

“A psychological phenomenon where people perceive a service to be more valuable when
they can see the effort being put into it, even if it doesn't necessarily result in a better
outcome.“

Speaking of which

This is the output of 100s of hours of research and analysis. Please subscribe to make it
worth it 🤪

Someone else’s credibility.

If you lack credibility, you can leverage the credibility and familiarity of a well-known and
respected person or company.

This is why people do a lot of Apple and Steve Jobs posts:

Credibility Hook Ideas

● “Last year my business did $10m in revenue...”
● “I’ve run two marathons...”
● “I spent X hours...” or “I analyzed 1000s of posts” or “I read 1000 emails...”
● “MrBeast videos have 49,273,123,390 views.”
● “I lost over $100,000 on these failures:”
2. How to write a hook with Fear
There’s a famous newspaper adage:

“If it bleeds, it reads.”

Fear and negativity works because:

● Loss Aversion : We’re more likely to take action to avoid losses than seek gains.
● Negativity Bias : People are more influenced by negative events, feedback, or
terminology than positive ones.
Fear hook examples

Fear can manifest in various ways:

FOMO – Fear of Missing Out
FOBO – Fear of Being Outdone
“I hope I’m not doing it wrong.”
“I hope that doesn’t happen to me.”
FOMO – Fear of Missing Out

“I don’t want to miss out or be left behind.”

It is super popular with AI fearmongering.

FOBO – Fear of Being Outdone

This blurs the line of credibility and FOBO. The fact that she’s making a 1% salary without
employees triggers anyone’s FOBO:

And Justin’s ridiculous schedule is enough to make anyone feel outdone.

“I hope I’m not doing it wrong.”

This benefits from the strong language of “suck at.”

“I hope that doesn’t happen to me.”

3. How to write a hook with Curiosity
When you're curious about something, your brain rewards you with a major dopamine hit when
you satisfy that curiosity. So when it’s pique, your brain becomes a junkie looking for a sweet
dopamine fix.

Curiosity hook examples

Frame things in such a way that makes you say:

● “Then what happened?”
● “I have to know more”
● “Hmm, what is it?”
● “What is going on?”
● “...?”
“Then what happened?”

Tease a fun and interesting story.

Andrew uses fun, colorful language to paint an intriguing picture:

“I have to know more”

First, the “hot take” gets you a bit since we like spiciness.

Second, Shaan is saying that we’re all wrong about the Metaverse. What are we wrong about?
Is he pro-Metaverse or anti-Metaverse?

“Hmm, what is it?”

Here, I share an image and tease at something. You’re forced to keep reading to figure out what
I’m pointing out.

Subscribed

“What is going on?”

Casey Neistat’s “Do What You Can’t” video became a rallying cry for internet creators.

But it didn’t start with him. And it didn't start with any dialogue.

Instead, it started with a man hanging from a helicopter on a ladder (and a cryptic title).

“...?”

This was a popular hook for a bit:

It’s the start of a sentence normally followed by something interesting or spicy.

Curiosity hook ideas

Shocking truth: “I used to sell drugs.”
Strong words: “Everyone is wrong about...”
Open a loop: “I don’t know who needs to hear this...” or “
Tease: “Look closely at most successful creators, and you’ll notice something:”
Start a story: “This is a story about how I lost $10,000,000...”
4. How to write a Counter-Narrative hook
Strong opinions and bold claims provoke dialogue and thought. Particularly if they contradict
things we already believe to be true.

Counter-Narrative hook examples

For example, everyone always says our attention spans are shrinking:

By countering the common narrative, he grabs our attention and gets us to keep reading. Just
like Justin and Katelyn do here:

You don’t expect a guy making 7-figures and a gal with 100k+ followers to shit on money making
and audience building.

Spiky points of view

Those examples are what Wes Kao calls “spiky points of view.”

Subscribed

5. How to write a hook with Eloquence
Eloquently putting a voice to an unvoiced concern, frustration, or opinion.

The magic is in finding and tapping into those unvoiced thoughts. And then summarize it
succinctly and powerfully.

Eloquence hook examples

You want people to say:

● “Finally, someone said it!”
● “That’s so damn true.”
“Finally, someone said it.”

Many of the comments on the following post were people saying: “Yes, finally, somebody said
this thing that I've been thinking.”

Chris hit an emotional nerve.

People are tired of companies virtue signaling rather than fixing fundamental problems.

“That’s so damn true”

Here, Andrew tapped into a feeling that every entrepreneur has had:

These are hard

You need to tap into unvoiced concerns and do sharp copywriting.

Tying it to a trending topic or news story is even better.

6. How to write a hook with Faces
This isn’t about writing. It’s about visuals. Specifically faces.

We're hardwired to notice and like faces—especially when they’re displaying strong emotions
(or they’re attractive).

We even naturally mimic the emotions we see in them through mirroring. That allows us to
understand those emotions and empathize better.

Faces hook examples

Here are five ways to use facial expressions in your hook:

Show your shock
Share a selfie
Non-tasteful versions
Boost credibility
Help people know where to look
Show your shock

Open mouth, a shocked expression: This is a classic on YouTube.

A shocked face gets your attention. You wanna know what caused it.

Share a selfie

It's been a trend on LinkedIn to share a photo of yourself, often combined with a semi-emotional
post. Codie Sanchez did a tasteful version of that:

We’ll naturally wonder why there are two photos side by side. We want to spot the differences
and discover what connects them.

Non-tasteful versions

Note that I called Codie's selfie “tasteful.” That's because it's relevant to the post.

When a selfie lacks context, it's less likely to be all that appealing, or be seen as
attention-seeking.

Example: the viral post when a CEO announced that he'd laid off staff and shared a photo of
himself crying:

Boost credibility

Faces can be combined with Credibility , the first hook type we discussed. If you reference
someone famous, use a photo of them:

Subscribed

Help people know where to look

Studies show that ads using an averted gaze draw more attention toward the product than ads
with a direct gaze:

We’re drawn to look at whatever someone else is looking at.

7. How to write a hook promising Value
Not every hook needs to blow people’s minds. Sometimes, it just needs to promise some
educational value so people know they can expect something useful.

Value hook examples

This opener is simple:

It tells you exactly what you’re gonna get by reading.

If you’re currently building a startup and thinking about brand strategy, or if you’re a marketer
who wants to hear Amanda's take, you’ll stop and go, “Hmm I should read this.”

Or here’s the first slide of a LinkedIn carousel I posted:

Yes, I leverage the Credibility/Familiarity of LinkedIn, and use the Faces of credible/familiar
people, but the hook is just promising exactly what they will get.

Handle Objections

A popular addition to this is to handle an obvious objection they may have:

Naval

Harsh Makadia

Ben Meer

People are naturally skeptical. Handle their objections upfront.

Just make sure that the value you promise is the value you deliver—otherwise, you create
clickbait.

Subscribed

8. How to write a hook with Surprise
People love surprising, amazing facts. People also love to share surprising facts due to “Social
Currency.” People’s perception of you changes based on the novelty of the information you
share.

You want people to go, “I didn't know that.” Or, “That's wild!”

Since you’re trying to hook readers quickly, you can’t share a surprising story.

You need to surprise them in a sentence or two. Do that with statistics:

Surprise hook examples

Codie Sanchez

Reno Perry

Justin Welsh

People love to be surprised and say, “I didn’t know that!”

Importantly, they also love sharing surprising discoveries—which can mean a high share rate on
this post type.

All 3 of the examples above could be shared just for the stats themselves. “Wow! Did you know
that 75m baby boomers are retiring soon?”

9. How to write a hook with Celebration
People love to celebrate wins. You want them to go, “I'm so happy for you/them/us.”

A couple of benefits of celebratory posts:

● People feel compelled to show their support, meaning a higher engagement rate.
● There’s a clear comment to make: “Congratulations!” Other post types can require some
thought when writing a comment. This one's easy.
Celebration hooks can be about many things, but some common ones are:

Celebration hook examples

Here are 3 obvious times to do a celebration hook:

● New jobs
● Miletones
● Birthdays
New jobs

They don't even have to provide additional value, like we've talked about with other hook types
( Education , Eloquence , etc.).

Again, people feel compelled to say congratulations, particularly if they know the person
personally or professionally.

Milestones

Here, Lenny shares a major newsletter milestone (note this is also Credibility ;0)

It warrants a, “Congrats, Lenny! That’s huge!”

Other milestones might include follower count, revenue, fundraising, and awards

Note: Lenny’s post also leverages Credibility (wow, he’s got 250k subs!) and FOBO: Fear of
Being Outdone. Just like this one:

Birthdays

Jay's post has Credibility and triggers FOBO (damn, I’m 33, and I haven’t done any of those
things...). So you post a “happy birthday” comment and keep reading.

Subscribed

10. How to write a hook with Identity
With this one, you want people to stop and say, “Hey, that's me!”

You're signaling who your post is for so those people know it’s relevant to them.

Identity hook examples

You can do that in two ways:

● Use a Barnum-style statement/question
● Label them directly
Use a Barnum-style statement/question

A statement that appears to be specific and tailored to an individual, but is actually vague
and general enough to apply to a wide range of people.

This is essentially how horoscopes work. They dance between specific and vague—and
occasionally really nail how you feel that day.

Question

Image from Why We Buy, compiled from Ship 30 for 30.

Statement

Label them directly

Or you can call out a group of people directly by name like Julian did for “movie nerds”:

Even better: Lump yourself into that community so they feel more connected to you (” my fellow
movie nerds”).

Better yet , use terminology that they use to describe themselves. For example, address Lady
Gaga fans by their preferred moniker: “Little Monsters.”

Subscribed

Hook examples and ideas
These are the 10 fundamental ways to hook, but as you have likely figured out by now, a single
post generally leverages multiple hook types. This is particularly true when the post contains
text and an image/video.

Fear + Value + Credibility + Faces

Note this one uses eye gazing effectively.

Rapid-fire Copywriting Tips
Here are 10 actionable tips to make your copywriting better.

You can use it as a checklist as you review and edit your copywriting.

1. Make it about them
Most people focus on what matters to them—their product and its features. Instead, talk
about what’s in it for them.

“People aren’t against you, they’re just for themselves.”

Think: What are the main problems you solve? How does their life change as a
result?

2. Make it relatable
Relate your product to something that they already understand perfectly. It’s a shortcut
to comprehension.

Tip: Ask/watch current customers how they explain your product to a friend. Find
the analogies they use.

3. Cut the fluff
Remove words that don’t add value. Particularly early on. People have infinite things
demanding their attention. You need to hook their interest as succinctly as possible.

Tip: Remove adverbs, adjectives, and filler words—it makes it punchier. Also try
restructuring the sentence entirely.

4. Use simple words
Don’t use a $10 word when a $0.05 word will do. Don’t use industry jargon either.
Pretend you’re explaining it to a 10-year old or a grandparent.

Tip: This applies even if your audience is highly intelligent. Everyone appreciates
it.

#5. Be specific & visual
Don't make them do the work. Spell it out for them and make it easy to picture what
they're getting.

Tip: Do audience research to identify the specific things they care about most and
highlight them.

#6. Use active voice
Active voice results in shorter, sharper sentences. Making your copy easier to follow
and finish.

Also notice that this one also makes YOUR client the star of the show, not the edits.

Tip: Place emphasis on the subject. Use specific verbs to describe the primary
action.

#7. Tell a story
Stories make it relatable, interesting, and real. Don't make them do the work. Illustrate.

Tip: Provide just enough details for readers to feel emotionally invested.

The first focuses on the what.

The second is a simple story that illustrates why someone should use the tutoring
service.

But imagine instead the story was:

"Little Johnny, a 10-year-old boy in New Hampshire, liked to ride bikes, collect pennies
in his stomach, and crush cans of Liquid Death.

Oh which reminds me, I don't really like the UX of Liquid Death. I can't close the can
and throw it into my bag after opening it!

Anyway, did I mention Little Johnny was not doing so well in Math class? Well, his
parents Suzy and Bob, an engineer... I think she's an electric engineer, and a doctor
(dermatologist maybe? whichever ones work with skin!), are deeply ashamed...blah
blah tutoring blah blah he's doing well now!"

Snore , right? The whole time you're telling the story, the other person is desperately
waiting for you to get to the point. And is confused about all these random details.

Wes Kao (founder of Maven and altMBA) says you need to find your story's MVB
( Minimum Viable Backstory ). Find the perfect amount of context to set the stage—and
cut the rest.

For example, that camping trip where you almost got eaten by a bear:

So tell stories in your copywriting, but cut out excess context. Your audience will be
more captivated. And your message won't get lost in a sea of irrelevant details.

#8. Make it punchy
Steal concepts from poetry. Use literary devices (here's a post summarizing some of the
best ones). Chop up sentences. Add rhyme and rhythm.

Tip: Don't focus on having impeccable grammar. Focus on making it fun and easy
to understand.

#9. Handle objections
Trying to sell something to someone without stopping to think through their most likely
objections is like this guy:

Identify the most common objections that come to people's mind. And proactively
handle them.

Tip: Ask customers: "What almost stopped you from buying?"

Here are examples using some well-known companies:

#10. Be bold
No one identifies with wishy-washy statements. Take strong stances to find your tribe.

Tip: You'll annoy some people, but they aren't your target audience. Say the things
your audience wishes they had the courage to say.

#11. Appeal to interest, not reason
People are profoundly illogical.

Our actions are predominately driven by emotion.

Then, we tell ourselves logical stories to rationalize our irrational behavior.

Savvy marketers and founders recognize this and leverage it.

Here’s an example from Poor Charlie’s Almanack:

In short, to convince, don’t appeal to reason.

Instead, appeal to their selfish interests.

Let’s dive into two tangible examples:

1. High-end electric car (ex: Tesla)

● Reason:
○ Environmental benefits.
○ Savings on gasoline.
○ Low maintenance costs compared to traditional gasoline vehicles.
● Interest:
○ Prestige from owning the newest Tesla.
○ Break-neck acceleration.
○ Quirky and novel features (whoopie cusions).
○ Futuristic Full-Self Driving that your friends will be wowed by.
2. Educational children’s toys

● Reason:
○ Explain how the toys enhance learning and development.
○ Discuss the safety of materials used.
○ Made from durable, high-quality materials.
● Interest:
○ Promote how these toys can make their child smarter.
○ The free time parents will have because the child will be distracted.
○ How the toys will help their children succeed in the future.
We all know that we shouldn’t eat sweets and fried foods.

They’re bad for our health after all.

Yet almost every single one of us does.

So clearly the logical argument is not compelling. So instead, find the self-interested
argument.

Apply these to your writing
Obviously not every sentence or piece can or will use all of the above, but let them be
your guiding light.

The Benefit of the Benefit
It’s a hot day. Your kids bounce off the walls, and you scroll Instagram to de-stress.

You’re hit with an ad for a Springfree trampoline. The ad shows kids double bouncing
each other into the air and off the enclosed walls.

Your eyes gloss over, and you start to scroll past.

And then the ad says:

“They’ll be distracted for hours while you lounge peacefully inside.”

You perk up. Now you’re interested.

Finally, a way to get some peace and quiet.

When someone buys a trampoline, what they're really buying is peace.

Find the benefit of the benefit
When you write copy to sell your product, sometimes it’s helpful to look at the “benefit of
a benefit.”

Note : this is more obvious when the buyer is different than the user, but that's not
a requirement. Use this exercise to uncover clever ways to pitch your product.

Step 1 :

Write a list of your product’s benefits AND its downsides.

You’ll see why in a second.

Step 2:

Analyze each and ask, “what’s a unexpected / obvious / helpful / interesting / funny /
convenient / comforting / amazing / wild / beautiful / exciting / weird... benefit of this
benefit/downside?”

In other words, what’s a second-order benefit of that benefit/downside?

It can either be directly for the user (kids on a trampoline) or for the real buyer/user
(relaxed parent).

A bunch of examples:

Trampoline → fun for multiple kids → parents get some time off

Sports car → no back seats (drawback) → no room for kids (there's a theme here)

Dog bed → dog will have a place to sleep → he won’t sleep in your bed

Electric car → no visiting gas stations → not caring when gas prices go up → not

Durex → no unexpected pregnancies → no kids stuff (Durex = cheaper than baby)

Jeep → amazing off road vehicle → can park anywhere

McDonald’s → open 24/7 → only food available on a late party night → good at
interpreting drunk people (note this is a benefit of a benefit of a benefit).

You get the point.

Do this simple exercise the next time you write copy for your site, an ad, an email, or a
piece of content. List all the benefits and downsides of your product. Then find the
second (or third) order benefit of each.

A lot will be rubbish. But you might strike gold.

Shoutout to Dan Nelken’s great book, A Self-Help Guide for Copywriters, for this
concept.

Tap into Relatable Truths
This is one of my favorite tweets about startups:

Clearly, it resonated with quite a lot of other people, too.

Why?

It summarizes a truth that I immediately got but failed to articulate previously:

Every successful person got lucky, and their success is nearly impossible to replicate.

Note: Paul Graham says that a founder’s best way to replicate this is to increase
their luck surface area by meeting people, writing online, building an audience,
living in a major city, etc.

This tweet taps into one of the most powerful ideas behind impactful marketing:
relatable truths.

Tapping into relatable truths makes your message more powerful and memorable.

In the book A Self-Help Guide for Copywriters, Dan gives examples of relatable truths
you can tap into during Christmas holidays:

Notice how you felt after each of them. Did you find yourself nodding along?

I know I did.

Let’s dive into the different types of relatable truths.

Here are a few ways to categorize relatable truths:
● Context : Truths related to where the message is seen. For example, an ad in LA:
● Holidays/events: Truths related to the current or recurring events such as
advertising your product during Valentine’s Day, Christmas, a US election, a
recession, or a global pandemic.
● Industry: Truths related to the specific industry you operate in. For example,
startups/business (like Andrew’s tweet), kids toys, dating, clothing, and for
marketers:

● Cultural: Truths related to social, societal, or cultural trends. Ranging from:
○ Hype trends : AI, crypto, Clubhouse, BeReal, and Squid Game.
○ Culture shifts : Sustainability, remote work, DEI, personal brands, creator
economy, urban diaspora, video > books, anon accounts, and mental
health awareness.
○ Technological shifts : Internet, mobile, AI, blockchain, virtual
reality/metaverse, 3d printing, quantum computing, and nuclear fusion.
○ Memes : rick rolling, ok boomer... too many to list.

● Human: Truths related to core human behavior and psychology. This is the most
broad-reaching and hardest to categorize. For example, how people act in an
embarrassing moment:

Spend time brainstorming relatable truths for your product, industry, culture, and
context. And add to this list whenever you come across one.

They’ll help your marketing resonate.

Microwave Headlines
Linus Pauling, a two-time Nobel Prize winner, famously said

“The way to get good ideas is to get lots of ideas, and throw the bad ones away.”

Creativity is a process.

You generally need dedicated time to sit down and focus on generating a lot of ideas.
Generally, the first stuff you make will be kinda “meh.” Then you’ll have an idea. You’ll
build on it. You’ll find ideas related to it. You find something else and build on that.

This continues until you’ve found various interesting ideas.

At least that’s what happens whenever we’re making ad creatives for clients, or
whenever I’m making carousels for LinkedIn.

But what if you don’t have that luxury of time? What if someone on the team comes to
you and says:

“Hey, you’re a good copywriter, what’s a clever way of saying X?”

Because with time, you can make a gourmet meal. But what if you only have 15
minutes? Well, in that case, you need to use a microwave.

And that’s what Dan calls a “Microwave Headline.”

Let’s dive into 6 techniques to get a decent headline in 15 minutes or less:

1. Ask them to write the bad “facts” version
Or as Dan says it, get them to “Say it straight, say it great.”

Ask the person (or yourself) to just state the facts.

This is useful for a few reasons:

It forces the requester to be more clear with the request by summarizing it in a
sentence.
It gives you a backup. If you can’t find a more clever way to do it, then give it an
edit and send it back with your approval.
As Harry Dry says it, all good writing and communication starts with a fact.
Instead of saying: “Tiger Woods wasn’t very strong today,” say: “Tiger Woods
normally averages X, and instead he’s Y today.”
1. This forces the reader to think and completely removes subjectivity.
Sometimes the factual statement is actually pretty good.

2. Smile headlines
This is a concept that Dan also calls The Mullet.

● Business in front : Put the factual business message upfront.
○ “Follow me on LinkedIn.”
○ “People swear by it.”
○ “Please enjoy responsibly.”
● Party in the back: Make them smile with a joke on the business message.
○ “Or I’ll keep following you in person.”
○ “And at it.”
○ “The Internet never forgets”
Try that and see if you make something better than “just the facts.”

3. Common quotes/phrases
Here you want to dive into pop culture, common phrases, or quotes.

Try to think of anything remotely related to your product or market (or words that rhyme
with things kind of sorta related).

The examples that Dan gives for a sporty deodorant are:

● “Don’t sweat the small stuff.” → “Don’t sweat the sweaty stuff.”
● “To be or not to be” → “To stink or not to stink.”
● “Be the change you want to see in the world” → “Be the scent you wish to
smell in the world.”
I asked ChatGPT to write some ideas to pitch itself... a lot were terrible but after some
prompting and editing, here’s what we came up with:

● "The pen is mightier than the sword." → "The prompt is mightier than the
pen."
● "Houston, we have a problem." → "Houston, we have a solution—ChatGPT."
○ Alternatively it could be “Houston, we had a problem.”
● "Think outside the box." → "Think outside the brain."
● "Ask and you shall receive." ****→ "Prompt and you shall receive."
4. Find some opposites
I’ll do exactly what Dan did here and share a quote from Thomas Kemeny’s book Junior,
Writing Your Way Ahead in Advertising.

“Clients love this shit. It’s cheap, but it works. Find some parallel you cna make in
the language between opposites. You can this with just about any brief, any client,
any boffer. For exdample, a bank wants you to talk about their low interest rates
on their platinum cards. You can be “Small rates. Big dela.” Or “Pay a little, get a
lot.” If you’re working on a car you could say, “Roars like a lion, priced lime a
lamb.” Or “Giant horsepower. Tiny price.”

Here are some examples for major tech companies I just came up with (with the help of
ChatGPT):

Apple: "Powerful inside. Beautiful outside."
Tesla: "Fast as lightning. Quiet as a whisper."
Airbnb: "Unique stays. Familiar comfort."
Google: "Search less. Find more."
Amazon: "Big variety. Small wait."
Netflix: "Big binge. Tiny cost."
5. 100 MPH Writing
That’s 160kph for the non-Americans and Brits in the audience.

Here, you set a timer for 15 minutes and write down as many ideas as you can.

Just let it flow. You can judge them at the end, and hopefully you vomited something
halfway decent out.

6. Fill a few buckets
This is a shortened version of the meat of Dan’s creative process, which we outlined in
Process to Generate Copy Ideas.

Here’s the high-level overview (this uses an example directly from A Self Help Guide for
Copywriters by Dan Nelken.

Step 1: Jot down a few very high-level value props/ideas. For example, for sporty
deodorant:

You won’t stink
You’ll smell nice
It’s good for you skin.
Yes they’re very dumb and high-level.

Step 2: Fill 3 buckets with more flesh out ideas

For example for “you won’t stink”

You can go from the gym to a date
YOu can go from the gym to the bar
You can go from the gym back to work
You can go into an elevator without offending people
You won’t smell like you just had a workout.
Step 3: Spend 5 minutes turning those into headlines

“From working out to working it.”
“From sweaty to ready.”
“From weight room to board room.”
“Do burpees. Don’t smell like burpees.”
Remember, writing is hard
Writing clearly and cleverly in a way that also increases someone’s desire to purchase
your product is insanely difficult.

But use these techniques above to slam out some solid headlines in a short timeframe.

Using Conflict
Most people either focus on themselves:

● Their story
● Their product’s features, benefits, etc
Or they focus purely on delivering their opinion or facts:

● This thing is good
● This thing is bad
But here’s the problem:

Everybody loves conflict
Anything without conflict is typically extremely boring.

Think about the stuff that people binge-watch:

● Dating shows like Love Is Blind and Too Hot to Handle
● Reality TV shows like Selling Sunset
● Dramas like Game of Thrones
Conflict. Conflict. Conflict.

When’s the last time someone binged a textbook with its cold, hard facts and total lack
of narrative or conflict?

Conflict is inherently interesting.

As a result, it’s one of the most powerful copywriting elements.

How to make people care to take their vitamin
Educational content is an absolute vitamin.

None of you need to be reading this right now. But you are because you know it’s good
for you, and I’ve made it interesting enough to keep you engaged.

Most people fail to do that.

As Harry Dry of Marketing Examples says, many people would say something like:

“Loom’s positioning is good because they do X, Y, and Z”

Whereas Harry does it by using storytelling and conflict:

If you’re paying attention, you noticed something
This is effectively what I’ve done with this very lesson.

I didn’t just say:

“Conflict makes for interesting content. Here’s how to do it.”

Instead, I:

● Started with what most people do wrong
● Moved on to why it’s wrong
● Then gave an example of a better way to do it
● Pointed out that’s what I’m doing and why (👈 where you are right now)
● Then finished with pointers on how to do it
In short:

You have to make people care enough to do the “hard” thing that’s good for
them.

Often, the hard thing is just spending time to consider your product.

People are busy, and they don’t care.

You need to make them care.

Conflict can help.

Pointers on how to use conflict
As Harry says in this great interview:

“You want pickle juice and orange juice. The pickle juice makes the orange juice
taste sweeter. The orange juice makes the pickle juice sourer.”

The contrast of the two extremes makes both more intense.

The problem seems worse.

The solution seems better.

Simple ways to introduce conflict:

● X vs. Y (including before and after)
● Here’s the problem, here’s why it sucks, here’s the solution
○ This is the classic PAS copywriting framework (see Copywriting
Frameworks lesson).
● Here’s how they do it. Here’s how we do it
● Tell a story of someone experiencing a problem
The next time you write copy, ensure there’s an element of conflict.

It’s one of the only ways to make people care.

Trigger Events
Have you ever used a freemium product for years and then suddenly decided to
upgrade to premium?

Or you’ve heard of a product over and over again, and finally you decide to buy it?

Those moments are the most important to dive into as a founder or marketer.

They’re called Trigger Events. A trigger event is an event or set of circumstances that
triggers someone to be interested in or take action on purchasing a product.

People will often suffer through painful problems for a long time before they finally have
a trigger event that pushes them to relieve it.

Momentum is powerful. You need an external jolt to change direction.

You want to tailor your copy and your marketing in general to your product's and
audience's trigger events.

Let's dive into how.

You want to dig into:
The common trigger events for your product.
The emotions customers feel at that moment.
The job the customers are hiring the product to perform.
How you might be able to target them and speak to them at that moment.
Whether they’re random, recurring, or caused by macro events. More on this
below.
A few examples of trigger events in action
New Year, New You (Seasonal) At the start of the year, people reflect on their
year and decide to make changes. Gym memberships and career changes spike.
Weather/Sports (Seasonal) : In a three-day period, four people asked me if I
skied. I felt ashamed to repeat that I never had, despite living in Vancouver with
five ski hills nearby. So, I signed up for lessons that night.
1. The trigger event was caused by it being the beginning of the season,
when everyone is excited about skiing.
2. The pain I experienced was being 30, not knowing how to ski, and having
to admit that to people. The trigger event made that pain more acute. The
job of the lessons was to make me less ashamed. If I had waited a few
weeks, fewer people would have been talking about skiing, and I would
have found a new pain to focus on.
Flush with cash (Random or yearly): A startup just raised money and is now
looking to ramp up marketing and hiring. Or someone just had payday or got their
tax refund
Keeping Up with the Jones': Someone buys a Tesla because their neighbor
did. An example from Branding That Means Business : In a 2007 survey, Prius
drivers said they bought their hybrid car mainly because it “makes a statement
about me” and “shows the world that its owner cares.” But in reality... “one of the
strongest predictors of whether someone buys a hybrid is whether the people in
their same neighbourhood own one.”
1. So much for caring about the environment 😂
Macro: A recession is starting, and companies are laying people off. People are
either looking for increased financial security, side hustles, or new jobs.
You can identify Trigger Events by

Talking to customers. Surveys. 1:1 calls. Casual DM or comment thread
convos.
1. Ask them what was going on in their lives before they purchased.
2. Ask them why they purchased.
3. Ask them when they decided to purchase.
4. Just be wary, the reasons they give are not necessarily the true reasons.
Dig deeper.
Observing customers. Reddit posts. Social posts. Quora questions. Look at
both the original post and the comments.
Observing competitors: Does your competitor’s marketing change throughout
the year? Has it changed recently? What do they say in their ads? You can use
the Meta Ad Library and Archive.org to dive into the past.
For this, a competitor doesn’t need to sell the same product. It needs to
target the same audience.
Speak to someone’s pain and emotional state at the moment they're most likely to
listen, and you’ll have their attention.

Introduction: Landing Pages
Overview
A landing page is a website you use in a marketing funnel.

It's where a user "lands" from some sort of source like an email, social post, ad, or piece
of content.

A homepage or product CAN be a landing page, but often they shouldn't be.

Why?

Because the best landing pages are completely tailored to a specific funnel.

For example:

● A landing page tailored to the specific ad copy/creative someone clicked
on Meta. It repeats the message, visuals, and intent of the ad.
○ Calling out a competitor? Compare yourself to that competitor.
○ Highlighting a specific feature or problem? Dive deep into that feature or
problem.
● A landing page tailored to the specific search query they typed in Google
○ A calculator that helps them figure out their macronutrient profile on
a keto diet when they google "keto calculator," which then pitches
some keto supplements.
● A landing page tailored to a specific offer
○ A social post on LinkedIn about hooks promotes an email course
about hooks and calls out "learn how to hook people on LinkedIn" in
the hero.
● A landing page tailored to a specific persona
○ You create an ad focused on people wanting to learn how to use AI to
create apps, and send them to a landing page completely dedicated to
speaking to their problems
Landing pages are just as crucial for conversion as the marketing that gets people's
attention in the first place—if not more important.

So we'll dive deep into:

● The important concepts and elements of landing pages
● Our most commonly recommend landing page format
● The other types of useful landing pages
● How to write landing page copy
● How to quickly design and develop landing pages with AI.
We'll also share our GPT that will roast your landing page so you can improve it.

Let's dive in.

Anatomy of a High-Converting Landing
Page
There are all kinds of landing pages, which we'll cover in future lessons.

But instead of just giving you a laundry list of ideas, we want to give you the 80/20
landing page structure. You can always experiment with radically different ideas later
(calculators, quizzes, advertorials, etc), but in most cases, especially early on, we
recommend the following structure.

Generally, the more you deviate from the following template, the more confused the
average visitor becomes.

Creativity in conversion-focused funnels is generally a bad thing. A confused person
bounces.

Here's a cheat sheet of this landing page structure:

Thanks to Tuff Growth for this great graphic. Instead of inventing our own
cheatsheet, we're leveraging there's throughout this lesson.

We'll dive into our recommendations for each of these sections. It is a lot of content so
we'll break it up into separate lessons.

For now, let's talk about some core landing page principles.

Think of your landing page from the perspective of a
visitor's likelihood to purchase:
💡 Purchase Rate = ( Desire + Confidence) / ( Effort + Confusion )

To increase a visitor's purchase rate, increase the visitor's desire and confidence while
decreasing their effort and confusion:

● Increase desire: Entice visitors with the transformative value your product will
provide.
● Increase confidence: Make them confident they’ll successfully get that value.
● Decrease labor: Reduce your visitors' effort so they don't get tired or annoyed.
Be concise and ensure every word and element is valuable.
● Decrease confusion: Don't confuse visitors with obscure or verbose messaging.
Ensure every sentence can be easily understood. And make it self-evident which
action they should take next (e.g. sign up or purchase). And ensure your action
elements (e.g. buttons) are unignorable.
Don’t do something avant-garde with your homepage structure unless you have a good
reason.

Here’s the typical landing page structure we'll be using:
Navbar : The top of the page — where your logo and navigation links are. Ideally
sticky.
1. Side or bottom navigation is cool and all, but confuses more than is
helpful.
Hero : The main section at the top of the page, which includes your header text,
subheader text, and captivating imagery.
Social proof : Logos of press coverage or your well-known customers.
Benefits and objections : Your key value propositions fully written out.
Social proof #2: Testimonials or results from past customers.
FAQ Section: Methodically answer all the major questions and objections
someone might have.
CTA (call to action): A dedicated section to entice them to take action.
Note: Each section should have a CTA to take them to the next step.
Footer : Miscellaneous links.
We'll walk through each of these elements in detail in the following lessons.

You can re-use this structure for a variety of LPs
For example, you can use this same structure for:

● Persona-specific landing pages
● Ad-specific landing pages
● Keyword-specific landing pages
● Funnel/product specific landing pages
● Problem-specific landing pages
You'd just change the words and images (and perhaps sections) used in the landing
page. But the structure can be relatively the same.

Let's dive into the different sections
Project: Write Your Landing Page
In the following lessons, we'll walk you through writing your landing page's various
sections.

The intention is that you write/plan these sections of your landing page as you work
through them.

To assist with that, we've created this template for you to work from:

Landing Page Copy Project
● Landing Page Cheatsheet
● Landing Page Template
Part 1: Navigation Bar
The more pathways you give someone to leave your landing page and funnel, the more likely
they will not convert.

Some of our highest-converting landing pages have Navbars with just the company logo on
one side and a button with the call-to-action on the other.

But if there are critical pages you can link to (like pricing or demos) then you can include them.

Directions:

Create 1-2 variations of your Navbar in the table below
○ Your CTA should be the rightmost option
○ Use 0 - 2 links to the left of your CTA
Navbar: Link 2 Link 1 CTA

Part 8: Footer
Much like the Nav, here you’ll want to keep it simple and only link to legally required pages
(Terms and Privacy Policy) and conversion critical pages (Pricing, Sign Up, Book a Demo, etc)

Directions

Determine if their are any key conversion-focused pages to link to
List out potential candidates
Text URL
Example: Pricing Example: /pricing
Optional: Additional sections
Directions:

Determine if any of the following are relevant for your business and decide if worth
creating:
1. Pricing : If you’re a service or SaaS business, maybe you want to put your pricing
table
2. Newsletter/lead magnet : Perhaps you want to give people a softer next step
rather than purely pushing them to a sale.
3. How it works: If you’re selling something a bit novel, consider a section that
details the steps involved to make it more clear.
4. Classic ecomm product section: Obviously if you’re an ecommerce company
and you’re making a product page, make the top of the page look like every other
ecommerce product page with the product title, price, images, description, etc.
5. You may also like: Again, if ecomm, do all the classic ecomm stuff. Copy

LP Section – Hero
The hero is the most important part of the page because everyone will see it. And the
most likely time that someone leaves your site is in the first few seconds.

The hero is 100% what determines if they keep reading or hit the back button.

Here’s the typical structure of your landing page “hero.”

"Hero" is jargon for the big section at the top of your page—what visitors first see before
they scroll down. It's also called your above-the-fold.

Homepage for Demand Curve.
Your hero consists of header text, subheader text, CTA, and often an image. You must
put a lot of thought into each of these. Nailing header copy has the highest impact on
whether people continue scrolling and reading.

Consider how people don't actually have short attention spans:

● They finish 3 hour Joe Rogan episodes.
● They binge 14 hour shows.
Instead, they have short consideration spans: they must be hooked quickly. So, don't
fear writing a long homepage.

But, ensure your hero is incredible.

💡 I cannot stress the important of hooks enough. Even the best landing page
won’t be read if it fails to hook them in the first few seconds. It needs to be clear,
compelling, and intriguing. Read our free email course on creating Unignorable
Hooks.

Hero — Header
The header must be fully descriptive of what you're selling and who it’s for.

If the visitor doesn't understand precisely what you do immediately upon landing, they'll
bounce out of laziness or skim-read the rest of the page and risk getting the wrong
impression.

Here's the litmus test for whether your header is sufficiently descriptive: If the visitor
reads only this text on your page , will they know exactly what you sell?

Bad headers—found all over the web—are those that read like slogans instead of
descriptions. For example:

● "Improve your workflow!"
● "Supercharge your collaboration!"
● “Software for humans.”
These are all useless.

If that's all we read on your page, we'd have no idea what the product actually is. And
we'll probably leave.

What does a good, descriptive header look like? Like
this:
● For a website design tool — "Visually design and develop sites from scratch.
No coding."
● For a grocery delivery service — "Groceries delivered in 1 hour. Say goodbye
to traffic, parking, and long lines."
● For a home rental service — "Rent people's homes. Experience a city like a
local."
Those help us understand what you're selling. And we can immediately self-identify as
someone who does in fact want what you're pitching, which means we'll have patience
to read through the rest of your site to get the details.

Let’s look at more examples.

On the left, we have a bad header. Pay attention to what makes the right example
better.

The right one is better because:

● It no longer sounds like corporate speak.
● It describes the specific benefit of the product.
Another example:

Again, the right one is better because:

● It no longer uses vague phrasing.
● It describes the specific benefit of your product.
Another:

The right one is better because:

● It doesn't talk in self-congratulatory terms. It talks in terms of benefits to the
visitor.
● It clarifies the specific outcome of using the product.
What these improved examples have in common is increased specificity.

Specificity is step one to strong header writing.

Header writing process
To write our header and subheader text, we'll follow two steps:

Identify how users get value from your product
Add a hook—to get them to keep reading
1. Identify how users get value
Value props are the ways people "get value" from your product.

Here's an exercise for finding your product's value props:

What bad alternative do people resort to when they lack your product?
How is your product better than that bad alternative?
Now turn the last step into an action statement—that's your value prop.
As an example, let's use the free language learning app Duolingo. It offers short-form,
interactive lessons.

A few more examples:

2. Add a hook
Adding a hook to your header can take two forms:

● A bold claim
● A response to likely skepticism
Hook option #1: Add a bold, specific claim

On the left, we have a vague statement. On the right, we have a specific, bold claim
about the benefit users will receive.

Now that's more enticing. Readers want to know how that's possible. So they keep
reading.

Another example:

In short, a bold claim is:

● Highly specific
● Triggers a dopamine hit of "wow, I didn't know that was possible."
Hook option #2: Address objections

As an alternative to including a bold claim, another way to create a hook is by
addressing a key objection in your header.

Let's use the website design tool, Webflow, as an example. Below is their header copy,
which hasn't yet been paired with a hook:

"Build your own website."

Upon seeing this, objections readers have could include:

● But, I don't know how to code. Don't websites require coding skills?
● This will take too long. I don't have the time. I'm not a trained designer.
● This will be low functionality and constraining like other site design tools.
Your job is to identify which of these is a major buying objection —and to proactively
address it. Don't let visitors retain their unaddressed concerns that cause them to
bounce before scrolling. See below:

In the examples above, we're expanding our header's first sentence plus adding a
second—in pursuit of our handling a key objection.

This requires balance. If you bloat your header with extraneous details, it becomes hard
to read. Don't try to address every objection—you can do that with the rest of your page.

Backing up, how do you go about identifying your customers' biggest objections?
Survey them:

● "What almost stopped you from buying?" That's an objection.
● "Why do you think non-customers haven't bought from us yet?" That's an
objection.
Let's revisit our earlier examples—this time with objection handling:

To recap, once you've identified your value prop, add a hook: either inject a bold claim
or proactively address an objection.

If your product targets multiple major personas, you can prompt visitors to choose which
persona they fit into at the top of your page. Then route them to the appropriate section
of your site. We call this "choose your own adventure." In the example below, Xeal
Energy creates different paths for apartment and workplace owners:

💡 Read our free email course on creating Unignorable Hooks.

Hero — Subheader
It's time to complement our header with a subheader, which will expand on what makes
our product special.

The subheader is commonly used for expanding on two thoughts:

How does our product work exactly?
Which of our features make our header's bold claim believable?
For example:

Similarly, Jupiter's first sentence explains their product (green). Then it explains how its
claim ("In just 5 minutes") is possible (blue).

As a rule of thumb, your subheader should only be one or two sentences. Don't make
this an essay. Keep reading breezy so visitors sustain their momentum.

Let's look at more examples:

Hero — Image
This will depend greatly on what your product is. But in general, you want to:

● Show the product in action (if physical) or visually represent the value they get
from it (intangibles like software).
● Research shows that adding people is a plus.
Don’t just add some crazy illustration of an astronaut or something.

Instead, use a visual to make it more obvious what you sell and why it’s valuable.

Use AI to create an image if you don't have the design resources!

Now onto Social Proof #1
LP Section – Social proof #1
Let's re-orient where we are in our page's structure:

We're on row three now: social proof.

Your first social proof section is a collage of logos showing off your press coverage
and/or your most well-known customers. Or if you're an ecommerce product, you can

state how many customers you have or the number of positive reviews (if it’s an
impressive amount).

It’ll look something like this:

Remember the equation we started this doc with:

💡 Purchase Rate = ( Desire + Confidence) / ( Effort + Confusion )

As a result, generally, with social proof, you have a few goals

Make it seem like everyone in the world already knows about you (increase
desire)
Increase the confidence they have that you can deliver the value (increase
confidence)
Highlight the transformative value others have received (increase desire +
confidence)
Make it clear who it’s for and what it does exactly (decrease confusion)
In this first social proof section, we’re just focusing on #1 and #2. Use logos and stats as
quick hits to increase their confidence and intrigue them enough to keep reading

The second social proof section (covered below) will highlight reviews, testimonials, and
case studies, to achieve all 4 of the benefits listed above.

💡 Note : If you don’t yet have noteworthy customers, you can provide your
product for free to people at well-known companies. Then, if they use you, place
their company logos on your site.

The social proof can also be built into the hero

It doesn’t need to be a separate section, in fact it may be better to include it in the above
the fold so it immediately smacks people in the face when they hit the page.

We do a collage of noteworthy clients on the homepage for our ads agency, Demand
Curve:

Now onto Features
LP Section – Features (benefits) and
objections
If needed, to put this back into context of the page, see "Benefits" below.

This section contains multiple features/benefits—often 3 to 6. Each is a value prop paired with
copy addressing objections that arise upon hearing that value prop:

● The header that states the value prop
● A paragraph explains the value prop and handles objections
● An image reinforces the value prop
● A CTA button for them to take action
Here’s how this looks in practice:

As you can imagine, the Features section spans the bulk of your page. Its job is to deliver your
product's complete sales pitch.

Benefits vs features
Most companies mess this section up by just listing out their features and talking about how
great they are.

The problem is when you talk about features you’re inherently focusing on you. You’re like that
guy at the party who just yammers on about how great he is.

Instead, focus on your customers. Your customers are the protagonist in this story and your
product is the supporting character in their transformative journey. **So we’re going to focus on
the benefits of each feature while handling any objections they may have in the process.

Got that? Okay, here’s a great example from Apple:

Apple here focuses on the benefit of their SOS and Crash detection features in the headline,
and then explain how the product achieves that benefit (the features).

Bonus tip: Carry the narrative
The best benefits sections carry a running narrative: Each benefits ties back to the dominant
value prop pitched in the hero section.

For example, if your hero value prop is “We help you put down your phone so you can focus on
the rest of your life,” a description of your Push Notification Blocking feature could include a
callback to the header such as this: “... so that you put an end to the habit of constantly looking
at your phone for updates.”

If you’re having a hard time deciding which value props and objections to highlight, study your
competitors' sites to learn how to differentiate yourself from what people already know about
your space.

Let’s dive into specific advice for each part of the Feature section.

Feature — Header
For a feature header, write a short value prop. Don't use vague language like "Empower your
sales" or "Revolutionize your workflow." Just bluntly describe the value prop so visitors can
quickly decide whether the value prop is relevant to them and whether they should read the
feature paragraph.

For example, here are feature headers for a portable grill:

● Cooks and sears
● No clean up
● Cooks more than just meat
💡 Again, people will skim and not read unless the headers effectively hook them. Read
our free email course on creating Unignorable Hooks.

Feature — Paragraph
In your feature's paragraph, concisely describe the feature and address important objections
that might prevent people from purchasing.

If it’s a complex or unintuitive feature, either link to a separate page where visitors can learn
more or have a button they can click or tooltip to reveal additional details.

The latter is preferable because it keeps users in the flow of your current page.

Feature — Image
Features are paired with an image so that your landing page isn't a giant wall of text and to
reinforce what you're describing.

For your feature image, consider two goals:

● Visually appealing: Modern, clear, and pretty. Pay a designer if you aren't one.
● Demonstrate the value of your product: Show the product in action. For software,
avoid useless abstract imagery.
HelloSign includes a GIF of their product in action in the example below. It shows us what we're
about to sign up for. It de-risks our time investment and removes uncertainty.

Further, instead of making the visitor read tiny text, they blur it out so you can focus on what
matters: how the product works.

Another example: If you're selling physical goods, consider doing two things:

Show off the various use cases or features
Show close-ups of the build quality. This gives visitors a fuller appreciation of the
product's magic. Here’ examples from Outway and Allbirds:
Feature – CTAs
You don’t know which feature/benefit will finally push someone over the edge to want to take
action. Therefore, don’t bury the call to action (CTA) buttons somewhere else on the page.

Let them take action immediately:

● Add a CTA to every feature section.
● When relevant, tailor the CTA text to the specific feature.
● Consider adding relevant social proof as well to overcome objections.
Here’s how Stripe does it:

Now onto Social Proof #2
LP Section – Social Proof #2
If needed, to put this back into context of the page, see the second "Social Proof" below.

As mentioned previously, these are the goals of a social proof section:

Make it seem like everyone in the world already knows about you (increase
desire)
Increase the confidence they have that you can deliver the value (increase
confidence)
Highlight the transformative value others have received (increase desire +
confidence)
Make it clear who it’s for and what it does exactly (decrease confusion)
This section uses testimonials, reviews, and case studies/results to achieve all four of
the goals. Here’s generally how it’s laid out:

The ideal reviews:

● Highlight the value they got
● Call out and handle common objections
● Are from trustworthy people or companies
● Include a photo of the reviewer or a logo of the company
Examples
Collage of reviews/testimonials

Here we use a collage of all the reviews we’ve had for our audience building cohort
course, Unignorable:

This is a great tactic for something higher volume where you have a lot of customers
where it’s easy to collect dozens of testimonials.

This same tactic can work with reviews for a consumer product.

Hand-picked customer results

For our ads agency, however, we don’t have dozens and dozens of reviews or results to
share because the volume is lower and a lot of clients don’t want to give testimonials or
for us to share results, so instead we go the more focused but highlighted route:

For 10 actionable, science-backed tips on displaying reviews/testimonials on your
landing page, check out our article.

Now onto the FAQ
LP Section – FAQ
If needed, to put this back into context of the page, see "FAQ" below.

People don’t really read.

Even if they’re trying to decide to sign up for a tool or agency that will cost them $100k
per year, they’ll skim. It’s just how we’re programmed.

Never assume people read your entire landing page. Ever.

The FAQ section is a place to dump everything in a nice catch all.

Generally, this is what it looks like:

What to cover in an FAQ section:

● All the benefits and features (repeat them)
● Common questions you get
○ Ask your customer support team
● Common objections they’d have (handle them)
○ Ask your customer support and sales team
● Who it’s for and who it’s not for
● Refund policies
Now onto the CTA section
LP Section – CTA
If needed, to put this back into context of the page, see "Benefits" below.

We talked about CTAs earlier, but lets dive deeper into them—both across the page and
in this dedicated section at the bottom of the page

Think of your CTA as the actionable next step to fulfilling the claim in your header.
Below, we have two strong examples. "Find food" and "Start learning" are continuations
of the magic teased in the header copy:

It feels natural to click these CTAs because they help the visitor continue the narrative
the hero kicked off.

In contrast, below is a weak CTA.

The copy is vague and unclear what the product is, so why would we request a
meeting?

CTA examples
The final section here is just reiterating your strong value props and using a CTA to
push them towards conversion. It’ll look something like this:

Here’s an example on our site:

Now onto the Footer
LP Section – Footer
If needed, to put this back into context of the page, see "Footer" below.

You can generally keep it pretty simple:

● Copyright info
● Links to privacy policy and terms (legally required)
● Links to key pages (pricing, dedicated feature pages, about, contact, etc)
○ If this landing page is your homepage, you’ll probably want to dump all the
links for your site here like for blog, newsletter, etc.
○ If it’s for a landing page for an ad or dedicated funnel, strip out all the
non-essential links.
If this is a conversion-focused landing page, now is not the time to link to 100
different pages. Don't let visitors get lost in the maze.

We also add this to the top of our footer to push people to our key pages:

Congrats, you've got a landing page!
Possible additional sections
Okay, you might be thinking, “Hey, this doesn’t include X section!”

Well, this guide and template are for the sections you’ll want on basically every landing
page ever.

But other sections might be relevant to add depending on your specific business. For
example:

Pricing : If you’re a service or SaaS business, maybe you want to put your pricing table.
For example, we do that on our homepage:

Newsletter/lead magnet : Perhaps you want to give people a softer next step rather
than purely pushing them to a sale. For example, putting a “subscribe to our newsletter”
section like we do that on our homepage here:

How it works: If you’re selling something a bit novel, consider a section that details the
steps involved to make it more clear. We do that on our matchmaking page here:

Classic ecomm product section: Obviously if you’re an ecommerce company and
you’re making a product page, make the top of the page look like every other
ecommerce product page with the product title, price, images, description, etc.

You may also like: Again, if ecommerce, do all the classic ecommerce stuff. Copy
Amazon.

Use this guide as a starting point. Consider additional sections when relevant.

General suggestions for conversion
Here are some rapid-fire ideas to ensure your page converts:

● Optimized for all devices. Make sure your site is legible and functional for large
monitors, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
● If the next step is subscribe to something, make the CTA the form. Instead
of making them go to a new page or click a button to open a modal, you can just
put the form right in the hero. We do that here:
● Never assume anything. Don’t assume they understand terms and acronyms.
Don’t assume they know who you are or what you do. Don’t assume they care.
● Always have CTAs handy. Put CTAs in basically every section and/or make
sure the navbar is sticky and has a CTA button.
● Use images to aid understanding. People understand images far better and
faster than words. Use images whenever you
● Skimmable. People don’t read. Make it so someone can quickly skim your
website and know who it’s for, what you do and why that matters to them.
● There’s no such thing as too much social proof. Seriously. The more the
better.
● Don’t assume you’ve nailed it perfectly. If you get lots of traffic, do an A/B test.
If you don’t get lots of traffic, get feedback (below) or use a service like Wynter.
Questions to Answer in Your Landing
Page
A lot of startup landing pages are extremely confusing—particularly software.

Way too often I hit a website and have no clue what they sell—even if I stick around and
read all the features and benefits on the homepage.

Confused people bounce and never return.

A landing page needs to answer these questions to be successful:

1. What is the product?

What does it do and how does it solve a problem they have?

Be extremely obvious.

Don't use fluffy filler words. Explain it like you would to grandma or nephew at
Thanksgiving.

2. Is it right for me? Am I the target audience?
A tool that helps you "be more productive" is completely different if it's for a single
parent, a corporate executive, or a solo creator.

Be clear whose problem the product solves—they'll feel more confident buying.

3. Is it legit?

Or does it look like a phishing/scam site to get your credit card info?

Invest a little in design. 80/20 is fine. Question 4 also helps.

4. Who else is using it? (Social proof)

People are more likely to buy if people and companies they respect are also customers.

"Oh if Airbnb and Microsoft say it's good, it must be!"

And if you add links to tweets from real accounts, it'll be verifiably legit.

5. How much?

Tell them how much it’s gonna cost them.

It's a waste of everyone's time if someone expects to pay $50/mo and gets quoted
$5,000/mo after a 30-minute sales demo.

Bonus: Find clever ways to position it so that the price seems like a deal.

6. Where can I get help?

You can't anticipate every question, and no one reads every sentence on the page or
FAQ.

Make it easy and obvious to contact you so you can answer their questions.

This also makes it seem more legit and that support is readily available. Use common
questions to fix the copy on your landing page so fewer people ask it.

7. How do I take action?
What is the next step that you want the person to take? It should be obvious.

Bonus: Match the CTA to the "temperature" of the lead.

If they're coming in cold, don't ask them to buy immediately. Get them on a newsletter or
free trial. If this is a landing page for a retargeting campaign or email, drive to a sale.

Getting feedback on your page
Rarely does a single person create the best version of a thing.

A variety of perspectives and opinions will almost always lead to a better landing page.

Once you have a landing page draft, pass it by two types of reviewers:

● People not in your market: Learn how appealing and comprehensible your
copy is to those unfamiliar with your market or product. Do you give them enough
context to want to know more? This will help cover the common problem where
your site over-assumes base-level knowledge on behalf of your audience. Many
people on the edge of your market may become customers if they better
understand why they should be.
● People in your market: Learn if your messaging is sufficiently unique and
descriptive to convince people high in intent to choose you over the competition.
For both types of reviewers, ask them to assess six criteria for you:

● Conversion: Are you willing to hand over your credit card and sign up right now?
If not, what would you need to see to get to that point?
● Interest: Rate how well the page sustained your interest on a scale of 1-10.
What should be rewritten or redesigned to help it sustain your interest better?
● Clarity: What’s unclear? What unanswered questions are you left with?
● Expansion: Did you find something awesome you wanted even more details on?
● Brevity: If you had to delete half the page's imagery and copy, which would it
be?
● Disbelief: What triggered your “Untrue! That’s scammy sales speak!” reflex?
● Objections: What would stop you from taking action?
Other Types of Landing Pages
It's incredibly easy to waste money on ads (either by losing it or not getting the most out
of it).

Sending your ads to a generic landing page is a surefire way to do just that.

The same concept applies to all marketing channels and campaigns, but it's particularly
painful when you're paying for the clicks.

Top startups use custom funnels and landing pages for their ads to drive higher
conversion rates.

This tactic is saying two things:

Don’t reuse existing ads with new landing pages. Create custom ad creatives for
each funnel type to match the user journey.
Don't reuse the same landing page for all your ads. Match the landing page to
the ad copy and creative.
Example: An ad creative comparing your product to a competitor should send them to a
page that compares them to that competitor—not your homepage or a product page.

Let's dive in.

#1. Interactive Calculators
Landing pages don't need to just do a hard sell. They can also be useful:

Offer a tool (e.g., ROI calculator, savings estimator) where users input data, see tailored
outcomes, and are prompted to buy or sign up while using or after.

This is great for any company where the user has a complex question they're trying to
answer that can be solved algorithmically. For example:

Source: Databox
● Health/Fitness: Macros, BMI, protein needs, etc.
● Marketing: ad budget calculator, LTV calculator, growth calculator, etc.
● Finance: Rent or buy, mortgage, car loan, compound interest, etc
2. Competitor Comparison
If your ad directly calls out a competitor, send them to a page that directly compares and
contrasts.

Webflow directly compares itself to Squarespace on a variety of metrics:

https://webflow.com/vs/squarespace
Note: If you're going to do that, make sure that you're honest and make your competitor
win where it actually wins. If you win every single category, it becomes less believable.

Shopify does a great job showing all the reasons why people choose them over
Woocommerce with this thorough landing page:

https://www.shopify.com/ca/compare/shopify-vs-woocommerce
Takeaway: Don't just compare in the ad, go deep and compare yourself to your
competitor side-by-side. Highlight your product’s superior features, pricing, or benefits,
with a CTA to purchase or sign up.

#3. Pre-Sales Landing Page
Normally marketing advice is focused on reducing the number of steps. Here you're
doing the opposite and purposefully putting a page in-between the ad and the product
page (or the App/Play Store).

For example, Ritual had a page that tells a story about personalized nutrition, and then
links to their product page for vitamins:

Source: https://x.com/oliviercroguy/status/1571948208850452484/photo/1
Takeaway: warm up cold traffic with storytelling and persuasive copy to build trust
before redirecting to a product page (or App/Play Stores).

Use a narrative-driven approach (pains, product benefits, “why now”), visuals, and a
clear CTA to transition to the product page.

#4. Free Trial/Welcome Offer
There's a reason why brands are constantly running promos—they work.

This landing page type's focus is getting them an exclusive welcome offer. For example,
here's AG1:

And here an example of an ad they used to get there:

Takeaway: Test an exclusive welcome offer and make a landing page completely
dedicated to it.

#5. Quiz Funnel
People hate risk.

A quiz is a great way to reduce the perceived risk in a purchase decision.

This is why bra brands like Third Love have quiz funnels to help you feel more
comfortable committing to a purchase:

https://www.thirdlove.com/en-ca/pages/fitting-room
And here's an ad that links to this quiz.

Takeaway: A quiz funnel works best for products where personalization, education, or
tailored recommendations increase conversions.

Here's a comprehensive list of examples.

#6. Advertorial (a.k.a. Blog Post)
Another way to soft sell is to link to a piece of content that educates your audience and
introduces your product naturally.

Here's an example from PetLabCo

We actually used to do this using my cofounder's old "Growth Guide" (which he's now
turned into a Startup Guide on his site).

This guide was a primary driver of both agency leads and Growth Program students for
2+ years.

Because it had proven itself to generate leads, we sent both cold and retargeting traffic
to it—which worked quite well.

Takeaway: Optimize the content for SEO and it can work both organically and for ads.

#7. Listicle
A listicle is one of the 10 primary types of content that is quite similar to an advertorial
but it's more directly product focused.

Generally best used for retargeting since it is more of a hard sell.

A listicle, as the name implies, is a list of things (reasons, tools, ways).

Here's an example from baby food brand Yumi:

https://x.com/oliviercroguy/status/1571948233102098432/photo/1
A classic listicle style is to compare the "best X tools" and then you include your own
tool and present it as the best. Here the listicle that Kit/ConvertKit made about the 13
best newsletter tools that conveniently ranks Kit first.

A few other rapidfire ideas:
Match the copy/imagery to the ad: A super simple hack is to simply tweak the copy and
images on the landing page to match the ad copy and creative. Matching landing page
copy to the keywords used on Google Ads is a classic tactic.

● Influencer : If you have a famous customer, affiliate, or super fan (and you have
their permission), you can highlight them on the page.
● Demo video : Make the page's focus an in-depth demo of your product or
service.
● Flash sale/limited promo pages : Make custom landing pages highlighting
short-term promos.
● Super minimal : Try a hilariously short and to-the-point page.
● Super long : Try one of those insanely long ClickFunnels-esque landing pages
that take 20 minutes to read.
● Social proof : A page where social proof is the star of the show with walls of
testimonials, reviews, case studies, and stats.
● Case studies : An advertorial of sorts where it's entirely focused on the results
your product/service has achieved for your customers
● No landing page : Lead-gen ads where you collect their contact info directly in
the platform can also work wonders.
Start small, expand from there
Don't go out and create all of these right away. Here's how to start:

Pick one funnel type and create custom ads and landing pages for it.
Look at your existing top-performing ads and create ads that build off the copy
and creative.
Once you see wins, iterate and expand to other funnel types.

Introduction: Ad Copy
Questions answered in this module
● How do I write ads that people actually click on and buy through?
● Does punctuation matter?
● How do I know what to write about in my ads?
● How do I choose the right type of creative to complement my copy?
Note: This reading pertains to social ads (Facebook/Instagram, Pinterest, etc).

Overview
Social ads are one of the most effective ways to find new customers and connect with
people already familiar with your company. But there's a big hurdle you have to
overcome if you want to make money off your ads: user intent.

Someone on Facebook is not actively searching for a product or service. It's not like
Google, where they want to find results related to their search. With Google, the right
type of ad can speak directly to their needs. That's not the case with social ads. People
go to Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest (to name a few) to be entertained. Or to catch
up with friends. And to discover new things.

No matter your niche, you can be certain your target audience spends a considerable
amount of time on sites like Facebook. It'd be an incredibly large missed opportunity to
not advertise to these folks where they spend hours each day.

But how do you do that?

If you want to connect with your audience and get them to convert when they're not
deliberately looking for something to buy, you have to know how to speak to them —
while at the same time conveying your core message.

At Demand Curve we spend a considerable amount of time not only crafting ad copy,
but continually refining it.

It's this cyclical process that's allowed us to crush it for our clients with social ads.

How to Write Compelling Ad Copy
What you’ll learn
● How to turn your value props into compelling ad copy suitable for all social
channels, and specific to targeted audiences.
Why is it important?
Ad copy is nothing like writing an email. Or an essay. Your ability to string sensible
thoughts together into sentences does not mean you can write good ad copy - the kind
of copy that gets people to stop scrolling through their feed.

This is a skill. Fortunately, it is a skill that can be learned, no matter your comfort level
with writing. And that’s actually what you’ll accomplish here.

Overview
In the strategy section of our course, we had you brainstorm value props, which will
serve as the foundation of your ad copy.

As you begin this writing phase, be sure to keep that spreadsheet readily available,
ideally in a separate window.

Also, it’s best if you have an idea of who you’re targeting with your ads. Use the
audiences you brainstormed in our Strategy section. Your value props help you know
what you’re pitching. Now it’s important to know who.

Open up a blank document (at Demand Curve, we prefer to work with Dropbox Paper
for its simple, clean interface). Copy the material found in this Ad Copy Template. This is
the template we use with all of our clients as we brainstorm ad copy variations.

Let’s break down this document bit by bit.

Ad copy is never set it and forget it. You’ll never create the perfect ad. But with constant
refining, you can keep improving your ads.

The process you learn in this lesson should be repeated periodically. Only then can you
continue to see a solid return on investment for your ads.

Example of a Facebook Ad

Example of an Instagram Feed ad

The section above shows the different parts of an ad on Facebook and Instagram. You’ll
create copy for each of these parts. Some social channels don’t need every part.

But they all require a headline and body, at the very least. We write every part for all of
our clients.

Some ad channels have specific character limits. For example, Facebook headlines
should be fewer than 40 characters, if you want to ensure the headline remains on one
line.

This section of the template gives you a breakdown of the character limits. You can use
our character counter spreadsheet to count the length of each ad copy element.

Writing ad copy variations
The remaining part of our template is dedicated to the actual ad copy. Let’s turn our
attention to that task now.

Staring at a blank screen is intimidating. Even with clear value props in hand, you may
not know how to craft the type of copy designed to convert.

That’s why when we create ad copy for clients, we often apply specific strategies to
simplify the process. These strategies have been tested over time and are proven to be
the most effective forms of ad copy. Regardless of your specific niche.

When you’re ready to write your ad copy, you’ll see in the template there are separate
table ‘blocks’ to place your copy in.

The first block, or section, you’ll see is “General Copy.”

This is copy that can be used with the widest possible audiences.

It’s important to brainstorm general ad copy variations (copy not specific to any one
audience). Brainstorming general variations is a good practice to identify your most
prominent value props, and it allows you to execute ads to the widest possible
audience, when you need.

You’ll also see a section in each block for carousel ads. This is a carousel ad:

Carousel ads allow you to show multiple images or videos in a single ad. Each
image/video has its own headline (and opportunity for creative copy). But they have the
same body copy.

You don’t need to fill out ad variations for carousel ads if you're not planning to run ads
on Facebook and Instagram. But if you are, we recommend it. These ad types can be
very effective.

The outline below is applicable whether you’re writing general copy, or copy specific to
an audience.

1. Creative copy
Each ad block on the template starts with the creative.

Your creative copy should either summarize the product, or focus on the your specific
audience’s biggest anxieties, as succinctly as possible. Keep it to two to seven words,
with rare exceptions.

It should almost always hit a value prop. You’ll often (but not always) want to add CTAs
to your creative — see "Learn More" in the Kip example below. We've found they
convert about 15% better.

Here are a few examples of real creatives we've made for clients, one of which includes
a CTA (Kip’s “Learn More”):

The examples above have little to no ‘design.’ We've found that these types of ads
convert best (more on this in our ad creative section).

2. Headline copy
We've found a few specific formulas that work best for headline copy:

● A headline that focuses on the target audience’s biggest anxieties (pull these
from the problem and implication sections of your value props sheet).
● A headline that focuses on the solution and benefits of your product.
● A straightforward description of the product itself.
● A headline that focuses on social proof: ratings, press, famous customers,
testimonials, etc.
Keep the headline to 50 characters or less.

Tips as you write headline copy:

● If the headline is one sentence, don’t end it with a period.
● If it’s two sentences or more, use periods.
● We've found headlines that use “the only ... in the world”, as in “the only organic
dog food in the world”, convert particularly well.
Here are a few examples of real headlines we've used for clients:

3. Body copy
Each ‘block’ in your ad template has three length options:

● Short body copy variations: (150 characters and less)
● Medium body copy variations: (150 - (roughly) 250 characters)
● Long body copy variations: (250+ characters)
You might think short copy outperforms the others. But our data tells us otherwise.
That’s why it’s a good idea to come up with at least a couple of variations for each body
length.

The more you test, the more you’ll know.

By the way, when you do come up with long body copy variations, it’s best to follow this
formula:

Hook
Product/service explanation
Handle objections
Write in a CTA
Example:

You say you’re going to cook dinner. But you don’t have the time.

Microwave dinners? Yeah, they’re quick. But have you looked at the ingredients?
You’re not going to get healthier eating those.

The Tovala Steam Oven makes it easy to eat delicious gourmet meals without
having to cook, clean, or complain. How?

We send you a box of gourmet meals. Plus our companion smart oven. Each meal
is cooked to perfection in 20 minutes or less.

You don’t do a thing. Well, except eat a home-cooked meal. Without having to
cook.

Choose your meal plan in seconds. Start eating healthy meals (without the hassle)
by next week.

When creating body copy, here are the strategies that we've found to convert best:

Explain how your product/service works. Step-by-step.

Here’s how Streak works:

▶Install it in 2 clicks. For free.

▶In seconds, your Gmail inbox converts into a complete CRM. So you can
manage leads, conversations, and more. All from a UI you already know And use
daily.

▶Know exactly when someone opens your email. And from what device.

▶Schedule emails to increase open rates.

▶Save your best performing emails as Snippets. So you can send more cold
emails. Faster.

▶Personalize your emails with Mail Merge.

Streak turns your inbox into the CRM you always wished it would be.

And the best part - it’s free.

(Note: emojis tend to perform pretty well in ad copy — it’s fine to include them.)

Articulate problem, solution, and benefit.

"Kip makes therapy more effective by helping you track your weekly progress
through self-assessments. No more guessing whether you're improving.”

Highlight differentiation (from competitors)

“The only automatic visitor logbook.”

Use a judgmental question.

“Your office doesn’t sign in visitors automatically?”

Use a quote that someone would use to talk about the problem.

“Yeah, we kept their CEO waiting for way too long.

No wonder we lost the deal.”

Reference big numbers and good reviews:

“#1 on Yelp”

Ask a pressing question

Did you know airlines will pay you ~$135 when they delay you?

Match one of your value props to a specific audience

Cost — "The only full-featured, 4K camera that’s affordable [quality] on a
student’s [audience] budget."

Powerful — "The only language learning tool with the advanced [quality]
features hardworking students [audience] need to master French, Chinese, and
more.”

Simple — "The analytics tool powerful enough for developers [audience] but built
with a super intuitive [quality] interface for marketers [audience].”

Make a statement your readers emotionally agree with. Then provide a

solution

Example: Training RNC’s sucks butt. Here’s a solution.

Compare your product/service against the status quo

Meaning, focus on how the current way to solve the problem sucks.

3b. Don’ts.
● Don’t use vaguaries.
○ Example: “At Bing Surfboards, we make your surf trip easier”.
○ An easier life is something anyone can pitch.
○ Instead, be specific about how the Bing Surfboard product actually makes
your life easier: by having the lightest surfboard on the planet, which
means you aren’t grunting pain and wasting energy every time you lug it to
the beach from your car.
● Don’t use cliche phrases like “earn more money” and “change your life”.
● Don’t use exclamation marks. They turn on people’s “this is salesy” reflex and
treat you like spam.
● Don’t try to be cute.
○ There was an ad for a New York taxi service that read: “If you hate waiting,
raise your hand.”
○ Instead, it should focus on how the drivers are safer than a car sharing
service (because of insurance, background checks, etc.), as well as a
shorter time-to-pickup and more comfortable seating.
● Don’t ask generic questions: “Do you like saving money?”
○ Instead, ask questions that prompt responses like, "Wow, I didn't know
that" and "No, tell me more..."
○ Better: “Did you know airlines will pay you ~$135 if you get delayed? “
● Don't ever write “tag someone” in the ad text, headline, or link description - your
ad won’t deliver properly and be flagged as “poor quality” by most channels.
4. Write the social proof section
Now write the social proof section for each of your value props. It should emphasize
social proof: famous companies using, big numbers, selectivity, etc.

Examples:

● The error tracking tool trusted by AirBnb and Microsoft
● Over 50,000,000 emails available
● How Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton reach their fans
If you have a totally new product, use this copy section for something other than social
proof. Add a secondary value prop or proactively address concerns someone would
have.

5. Retargeting Ads
Retargeting ads are shown to audiences who have interacted with your brand or
product in some way in the past.

Maybe they visited your website, FB or IG page. Depending on where you set up your
retargeting pixel (for example, a specific page on your website) you can create ads that
speak directly to this audience group.

The message you deliver to someone who already interacted with your brand should be
different from a message you deliver to a stranger.

Specifically, they're farther along their buying journey. You can assume they know more
about your product, and you can hit them with more specific copy to compel them to
buy.

This means you don't have to waste time explaining what your product is. It's more
important to cover all the different problems your product solves, in the hope that one
hits. In other words, emphasize the use cases, and not the product in general.

Project: Social Ad Copy
You're going to write ad copy for a variety of ads that you’ll run for your business.

The elements required for LinkedIn ads are similar to Facebook ads (minus the
newsfeed, which is unique to Facebook). You’ll be creating one set of ads, which you
can then apply to both social platforms.

First, we're going to come up with a giant pool of copy to draw from. Then, we're going
to pick the best variations to make your first ad units.

Prerequisites:
● Value Prop Spreadsheet (from day 1)
○ You should already have at least three value props specific to your target
audience from doing the exercise in the Strategy section. Do that if you
have not done it yet.
● Audiences you're targeting (from day 1)
Phase 1: Write your ad copy pool
This will consume most of your project time.

Phase 1a: Setup
First, go to Ad Copy: Additional Resources > Template: Ad Copy , and make a copy
of the doc.

Scroll through it. Where it says "Target Audience 1," fill in the audience you prioritized in
your growth strategy doc from day 1.

Only add your top audience for now.

You can write copy for other audiences later, but it will be too time-consuming for you to
write in the scope of the training. (You can apply what you learn to future copy you
write.)

If you’re only targeting a General Audience for now, you can skip the Target Audience 1
section.

Second, open up this ad copy reference doc. It shows you the common mistakes
students make when writing ad copy for the first time. Reviewing it will save you literally
hours of rewrites.

Phase 1b: Copywriting
Then, fill out the ad template with variations of the following:

● Creative copy - 3-4 variations
● Headline - 3-4 variations
● Short body copy - (150 characters or less) - 2-3 variations
● Medium body copy - (150 - 250 characters) - 2-3 variations
● Long body copy - (250 characters or more) - 2-3 variations
● Social Proof - 3 variations
Each variation you write should either: A) cover a different value prop, or B) use a
different phrasing or style to convey its value prop.

Steal from the reading where you can.

Then, if you plan to run ads on Facebook and Instagram, fill out the carousel section as
well.

Warning: To reiterate... don’t stray from your value props! They’re what make you
unique and they help you generate ad copy. You can sometimes rip ad copy directly
from your value props doc to save time.

Please. Avoid vague language.

Phase 2: Count your characters
Next, copy and use this template to count your characters. Certain elements of your ad
copy have strict character limits, depending on where you’re running ads.

Phase 3: Self-Review
Run through this checklist for each piece of ad copy you expect to run with. This is what
we use internally at Demand Curve.

Phase 4: Group Together
Go to Ad Copy: Additional Resources > Template: Grouped Ad Copy, and make your
own copy.

Make headers for each audience from the last doc.

Group together your copy from the pool you made. Make three complete ads per
audience (General and Audience 1). So you should have 6 complete ads total. You’ll
want to test different lengths and formats, so the 3 ads should be:

● 1 short or medium copy variation
● 1 long copy variation
● 1 carousel ad
Each ad should have:

● Creative copy
● A short text description of the image
● A headline
● Body copy (can be short, medium, or long)
● Social proof
These are the actual ads you'll be running on Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. So put some
effort into them. Be careful not to use the same phrasing in each section of the ad.

Every section (creative copy, headline, etc.) should fit with the others to hook the reader
and compel them to click.

If a burst of inspiration strikes and you decide to write new, better-tailored copy when
you group these ads together, that's fine. In fact, we encourage it.

Ultimately, we want to test wildly different ways to resonate with our reader.

● Body copy = Primary text that appears above an ad's image
● Creative copy = Words that appear on the ad's image
● Headline copy = Text that appears in big, bold letters below an ad's image
● Social proof = Text that appears below the headline
Character Limits
Every channel has its own character limits.

When we write ad copy across channels, we save time by writing copy for the platform with the
most restrictions. For example, 150 characters max for the body copy, so it can be used for both
Facebook and LinkedIn.

LinkedIn — Sponsored Content
Headline: 70 characters
Body: 150 characters

LinkedIn — Text-Ads
Headline: 25 characters
Body: 75 characters

Facebook:
Headline: 40 characters

Body:

● We keep the character count to 140 if we intend to use the same copy for LinkedIn &
Twitter
● We get 90 characters before it displays "...more"
● Newsfeed description: We get 30 characters before it displays "...more"
Quora
Headline: 65 characters
Body: 105 characters

Twitter
Headline: 70 characters maximum. 50 characters before it gets truncated

AdWords
Headlines: 30 characters
Description: 80 characters

Note: AdWords has very different ad copy requirements in terms of usage. You always
want to match ad copy to the keywords the ad is targeting. So the ad copy is constantly
shifting to match the targeted keyword. But we use the templates below as guidance.
General Copy
Creative:
Words that appear on the ad's image.

The creative copy needs to be able to standalone and explain what your product/company does
even if users skip the rest of the ad. This is especially important on Instagram where the body
copy is collapsed by default.

Social proof:
Text that appears below the headline

● Social proof variation 1
● Social proof variation 2

Carousel ads

Carousel ads have 1 global body copy that’s shared by all the slides.

● The body copy needs to explain what your product does at a high level so there’s
enough context for someone seeing the ad for the first time.
● Slide 1 also needs to explain what your product/company does. On Instagram
placements, the body copy is not always shown so Slide 1 has to accomplish the same
goal.
● For subsequent slides, make sure the include creative copy.
● The various slides can be used various ways:
○ Highlighting individual features
○ Highlighting various eCommerce products
○ Explain how your product works in sequential steps

ntroduction: Ad Creatives
The era of the data-driven marketer is over.

Ad platforms are so sophisticated now that you can just throw some creatives in an
Advantage+ campaign and get solid conversions—without meticulously tweaking
audience targeting, bid strategies, or manual optimizations like before.

In fact, getting too fancy with manual targeting can actually hurt your performance.

The algorithm does all the heavy lifting for you.

So, what moves the needle now?

Ad creative.

Creatives are:

The new targeting.
The new competitive advantage.
The difference between a profitable campaign and a flop isn’t how well you
analyze your metrics
It’s all about how scroll-stopping, engaging, and persuasive your creative is.

And the best part? Anyone can make great creatives with the principles and tools we’re
about to share. You don’t have to be a designer or expert copywriter to make some solid
ad creatives that convert.

But first, to clarify one thing...

What is an ad creative?
Ad creatives are the visuals in your ads—images, videos, carousels, or UGC
(user-generated content). They grab attention, stop the scroll, and ultimately dictate
whether someone clicks or not.

If your ads aren’t converting?

It’s likely not your targeting—it’s your creative.

Our ad creative philosophy
The key to ad creatives is to:

Don't make people think. It should be immediately obvious to them at a glance.
Don't be fancy. Simple, clean, and straightforward is almost always best.
Try not to be a “creative copywriter.” You're not trying to win an award, you're
trying to sell a product.
Let’s face it: your “creative ad” will only work if you’re a big brand like McDonalds.

Not if you’re a startup no one knows yet. When you’re unknown, your creatives need to
be direct and to the point. You can’t make people think.

Even those creative ads that win awards mostly just get praise from other advertisers,
and don't necessarily do what matters: drive sales.

The more "intellectually interesting" or out-of-the-box creative the ad is, often the less
likely it will be to convert.

And don't bury the lede with your ad.

You have milliseconds to intrigue someone.

Don't have something confusing and obscure in the headline only to show the real value
in the subheader.

People don't read the subheader if the header is confusing.

Example of a recruiting ad that still makes people think: "Hire in 48 hours"

● hire who?
● does it cost money?
Get in the mindset of the audience

You can't produce ad creatives that resonate with people if you don't deeply understand:

Who they are
What problems they're struggling with
What they're worried about
What their selfish desires are
What they care about
Don't just think about their age, gender, location, or job. Think about the context they're
in. Think about their culture. Think about

If they see an ad on instagram, where are they at that moment? Probably chilling on the
couch, tv on, scrolling on their phone, their wife is nagging them, the cat just pushed
something off the table. A lot of stimulus going on.

They're not going to sit down and read your ad unless you give them a really good
reason to.

Don't talk about you, talk about them

Don't say "we're the best company to do X in the world"

Say "We'll solve X problem for you better than anyone in the world"

We're all selfish creatures. We care first and foremost about how others will solve our
problems and make our lives better. Not what makes THEM great.

Kill your darlings

Ruthlessly cut meaningless words or elements that don't add to the value of what you're
saying.

"Get growth hires for free in your inbox"

● What does "in your inbox" have to do with anything? Does that mean anything?
You can cut this to say, “Get growth hires for free.”
Key components of performant ads

Consumer neuroscience research has found that highly successful ads score well on

three key dimensions:

Attention (ex: familiarity + peculiarity),
Conversion to long-term memory (ex: peculiarity + humor),
Emotional engagement (ex: humor)
You want to create ads that check those boxes.

Let's dive into the nitty gritty of ad creatives
Core elements of ad creatives
An ad creative is only made up of two components: text and visuals.

BUT there are infinite ways to arrange text and visuals.

Let's break this down further into:

● The hook/angle
● The visuals
● CTA
● The format
In this lesson, we'll cover the first three, and the next lesson we'll cover formats.

Let's dive in.

Hooks & Angles
Get in the mindset of your customer.

They're browsing Instagram, TikTok, or LinkedIn during a quiet moment. They're
scrolling from cat video to cat video. Suddenly your ad pops up to disturb them.

The hook is that crucial first impression that either hooks them in or keeps them
scrolling to the next cat video.

Whether it’s a video or static ad, the hook needs to accomplish the same two things:

Grab your audience’s attention
And get them curious about what you have to say.
And the angle has to sell the product in a compelling way.

The best ads don’t just grab attention. They frame the product in the most persuasive
way possible.

Hooks and angles work together to drive conversions.

Hooks that work well:

● Pattern interrupts: unexpected visuals that break the norm. If you’re scrolling
past a bunch of highly polished, high-production ads, then an ad shot with your
iPhone at a weird angle is gonna make you stop and look.
○ Ugly Ads: (more on these later)
■ handwritten content, sticky notes, iPhone footage
● Curiosity gap: Leave out key details to create intrigue.
○ “Nobody’s talking about this, but it’s so smart.”
○ “Did you know 80% of people do this wrong?”
○ “Did you know [X] is secretly ruining your [Y]”
● Problem-agitate: Directly call out a pain point, twist the knife, and frame your
product as the solution.
○ “Can’t stay asleep? You might be losing years of your life because of it.
SleepAid fixes this.”
● Social proof: Leverage testimonials, statistics, and credibility.
○ “Join over 10,000+ professional marketers”
○ “As seen on.. [techcrunch, YC, forbes]”
○ “93% of people shown improvement after [X]”
● This vs. That: Contrast between two things. Usually you vs. your competitor, or
a generalized competitor (Blissy Pillowcase vs. Generic silk pillowcase)
○ Us vs Them
○ Before/After
○ Old way vs New way
○ Problem → Solution
● Contrarian Hook: Something that goes against common beliefs, “I didn’t think
that was true”
○ “Everything you’ve been told about [X] is wrong”
○ “Stop using melatonin gummies. They actually harm your sleep. Use this
instead.”
○ “Why I stopped doing [popular thing] and what I do instead”
● Persona/identity callout: Call out who it’s for directly in the ad.
○ “The productivity tool designed for ADHD”
○ “CEO Starter Pack”

○ “If you grew up in the 90s, you need this”
● Authority/credibility hook: Establish yourself as an expert in your field.
○ “As a [doctor, scientist, 3x exited founder], I can tell you this works.”
○ “We analyzed 10,000+ [X] and here’s what we found”
● POV hook: Make the reader feel like they’re part of the experience. Great for
UGC style ads.
○ “POV: It’s your first day at your dream job”
○ “POV: You’re still using [outdated method], while everyone is doing this”
● Listicle: You can never go wrong with the classic structured list approach.
○ “3 reasons why I’ll never do [x] again”
○ “5 things you need to try out”
○ “7 reasons why your marketing funnel isn’t working.”
Hook Type Matching Angle
Pattern Interrupt Native UGC, fast-cutting edits, lofi/ugly
Curiosity Gap Before/after, hidden benefits
Problem-Agitate Direct-response, testimonial-driven
Social Proof Expert endorsement, data-driven
Us vs. Them Competitive comparison, value-based
Contrarian Thought leadership, disruptive trends
Persona Callout Niche-focused, pain point solving
Authority Expert-driven, trust-building
POV Relatable storytelling, lifestyle-driven
Listicle Quick takeaways, informative & structured
💡 Pro tip : If you see a hook style you like but not a good example for your brand,
copy the hook type and examples into ChatGPT/Claude/Grok, tell it a bit about
your brand, and then ask it to generate 20 more ideas based on what it knows
about your brand. Narrow in on what you like, then ask it to generate 20 more like
the ones you like.

The visuals
The visuals in your ad are the first thing people see— they determine whether
someone stops scrolling or keeps moving. Even with a strong hook, bad visuals can
ruin an ad's performance.

Here’s how to make your ad visuals more effective, engaging, and
high-converting.

#1. Make It Instantly Understandable

People scroll fast. If your ad isn’t clear in 1 second, it’s too complicated.

The best ads make their value proposition obvious at a glance.

Example: Showing popular productivity apps in a trash can is far hookier than just
showing an image of the product.

#2. Show, Don’t Tell

If your product solves a problem, literally show that problem being solved in your
visuals.

A skincare ad shouldn’t just show a cream jar—it should show before-and-after skin
transformation.

#3. Mimic Native Content

Your ad should blend into the platform it’s running on (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook,
YouTube).

Ads that look like organic content tend to get higher engagement.

#4. Keep it clean & uncluttered

Too many elements = visual confusion = people skip your ad.

Less is more—focus on one key message per visual.

Here's an example where there's too much happening :

Here's a simplified version:

#5. Use contrast to stand out

Avoid muted or dull colors that blend in.

Bright colors, bold text, and clear subject focus = more visibility in crowded feeds.

#6. Common interface hi-jacking

Use interfaces that people are already familiar with. If someone sees a text message
exchange on their feed, they can’t help but stop and read it.

For example, Notes apps, text messages, slack threads, notifications, tweets, etc.

#7. Use visual hierarchy

What should be the first thing people read? Then the second? Then the third?

Bad visual hierarchy:

Everything is a similar size and is equally competing for your attention.

Different people will notice different things first.

Good visual hierarchy:

When you look at the above you'll first read the headline. That's because the image,
logo, and filler text are all emphasized less.

This great reference really shows this off:

Source: Creator Fuel
Here's a great table for Visual Hierarchy:

Make the most important things highly visible. Make the secondary things low visibility.

The CTA (Driving Action)
Here's an ad creative with a CTA:

It's the "Book a demo" button at the bottom.

Not all ad creatives need a CTA, but they can help provide secondary information or
push someone to the next action.

The Call-to-Action should be clear, concise, and compelling.

There should only be one CTA. What is the one action you want your users to take?

Examples of contextualized CTAs

Here are some CTAs contextualized to the specific companies:

Credit: https://x.com/namyakhann/status/1902721818659827755
Best practices:

● Use direct action words – "Shop Now," "Get Started," "Try It Free."
● Benefit-driven CTA – "Claim Your Free Trial Today."
● Create urgency – "Limited spots available – don’t miss out!"
Okay, now let's dive into the formats
Ad creative formats
Your ad format is just as important as your hook and angle. The way you present your
message determines how well it resonates with your audience and how much
engagement your ad receives.

Think of ad formats as the "packaging" of your hook and angle.

Even if you have a killer message, the wrong format can make people ignore your ad.

Static image ads:
The classic image ad.

Great for getting ads out quickly, as they’re just an image with a text hook/headline.
Typically quick, high-impact messaging.

They work best when what you’re selling is easy to understand at a glance.

If your product is novel or complex, a video does a better job explaining it.

If it’s something people already understand, but for a new market for example, you can
lean on statics more. “It’s like Duolingo for addiction” .. “It’s like Notion but without the
setup”

Static image ad formats:

Value prop/direct response ads

These ads are to the point

This vs. That comparisons

Here you directly contrast two things.

Generally this can be:

● Your product vs competitors
● Old way vs new way
● Before vs after
● Good vs bad
Static testimonials

Here you specifically highlight one or more testimonials:

Feature callouts

Here you have your product and have various value props/features called out:

Ugly ads

Purposely low-budget ads that look like organic content:

Press screenshots -

Here you either use a direct screenshot of a press article about your product.

OR, you make it look like a “fake blog post” or “fake breaking news”

Social proof

Here you highlight social proof like impressive users, clients, review scores, or numbers:

Meme

You use meme generators to make memes that are really ads:

Our highest performing ad for our client VideoGen:

Problem callout

Here you directly callout someone's problem:

Common interface

You make an ad that looks like something they're familiar with:

Motion ads
This is a motion ad:

They’re easier to produce than video, and can tell more of a story than statics can.

They enable you to highlight key features in a simple, but engaging way and they make
your typical statics more eye catching.

User-generated content
User-Generated Content (UGC) is one of the highest-performing ad formats because it
feels authentic and organic. It blends in with the content people already engage with,

making it more likely to capture attention and drive conversions. And they’re actually
really easy to make.

UGC Formats:

1. Unboxing & First Impression

Unboxing videos capture the experience of opening a product for the first time. These
ads rely on curiosity and excitement to keep viewers engaged.

Why it works:

● Feels raw and authentic, making it more believable.
● Captures real-time reactions, which makes the product seem more desirable.
● Builds curiosity, especially if the product is something people haven't seen
before.
Best for:

B eauty, electronics, clothing, luxury items, and anything with premium packaging.

Examples to test:

● Someone unboxing a product with close-ups of packaging details.
● A first impression review where the creator reacts to different features.
● A side-by-side comparison of expectations vs. reality.
2. Product Usage / Demonstration
Shows how the product actually works in real life. This format is effective because it
removes uncertainty and highlights key features.

Why it works:

● Helps potential buyers visualize how they would use the product.
● Provides proof that the product delivers on its claims.
● Removes purchase friction by showing real-world benefits.
Best for:

Tech, SaaS, kitchen gadgets, skincare, fitness equipment, and any product that solves a
pain point.

Examples to test:

● A tutorial showing how to use the product in under 30 seconds.
● A creator explaining their favorite feature while using the product.
● A fast-motion demo showing results over time.
3. Challenge or Progress Series
A creator documents their experience with a product over a set period (7 days, 30 days,
etc.), tracking results.

Why it works:

● Builds anticipation and curiosity—people want to see the outcome.
● Creates a sense of credibility since results unfold naturally over time.
● Keeps users engaged across multiple ads or posts.
Best for:

Health, fitness, skincare, supplements, finance, and productivity apps.

Examples to test:

● “I used this for 30 days—here’s what happened.”
● A creator checking in daily with progress updates.
● A split-screen before-and-after comparison.
4. Day-in-the-Life
A casual, natural integration of a product into someone's daily routine. Feels less like an
ad and more like content someone would post on social media.

Why it works:

● Shows how the product fits seamlessly into daily habits.
● Feels effortless, making it more relatable and engaging.
● Blends in with organic content, making it feel more trustworthy.
Best for:

Supplements, skincare, fashion, tech, coffee, and lifestyle brands.

Examples to test:

● A morning routine featuring the product.
● A “What I use every day” roundup with the product included.
● A creator subtly mentioning the product while going about their routine.
5. Q&A or AMA (Ask Me Anything)
A creator answers common questions about the product, either from real users or
scripted questions.

Why it works:

● Positions the creator as a trusted voice, making the product feel credible.
● Addresses common objections, reducing hesitation.
● Engages viewers by anticipating what they’re already wondering.
Best for:

B2B, SaaS, high-ticket items, and products that require more education.

Examples to test:

● “Here’s what people always ask about this product.”
● A creator responding to a real customer comment or review.
● A FAQ-style breakdown covering product details and benefits.
6. Memes
Meme-style ads mimic viral internet culture, using humor or relatability to drive
engagement. These often involve screenshots of tweets, pop culture references, or
exaggerated situations.

Why it works:

● Doesn't look like an ad, so it blends naturally into feeds.
● Highly shareable, increasing organic reach.
● Makes the brand feel more human and approachable.
Best for:

Consumer brands, lifestyle products, and social media-heavy audiences.

Examples to test:

● A side-by-side meme format (expectations vs. reality).
● A Twitter-style text post paired with a reaction video.
● A pop culture reference applied to the product.
7. Entertainment / Storytelling
A narrative-driven approach that makes the ad feel like a mini story rather than a direct
promotion.

Why it works:

● Hooks people in emotionally rather than focusing on just features.
● Keeps viewers watching longer, leading to better engagement.
● Works well with humorous, dramatic, or suspenseful storytelling.
Best for:

Anything that benefits from deeper engagement—fashion, tech, lifestyle, and fitness
brands.

Examples to test:

● “Here’s the time I almost missed my flight, but this product saved me.”
● A creator telling a personal story that leads into the product.
● A comedic skit that highlights the product’s value.
8. Education / Value-Driven
The creator teaches the audience something valuable. The product doesn’t need to be
in the video, you just need to teach your audience something interesting. It positions
your brand as an authority.

Why it works:

● Provides useful information, making the ad feel less salesy.
● Builds trust by positioning the brand as an authority.
● Works especially well in high-consideration purchases.
Best for:

Finance, SaaS, supplements, skincare, fitness, and any industry where people want to
make informed decisions.

Examples to test:

● “3 things you didn’t know about [industry/product].”
● A creator explaining the science behind why the product works.
● A side-by-side comparison of myths vs. facts.
9. Problem / Solution
Directly addresses a pain point, then positions the product as the best solution.

Why it works:

● Relatable and straightforward—people immediately connect to the problem.
● Clearly highlights the benefits of the product.
● Works well for retargeting or direct-response ads.
Best for:

Health, wellness, skincare, B2B, and high-ticket products.

Examples to test:

● “Struggling with [problem]? This fixes it.”
● A side-by-side comparison of life with vs. without the product.
● A creator acting out a relatable problem, followed by the solution.
10. Testimonial UGC
A real customer (preferably a pre-existing content creator, not a random person that
can’t talk in front of a camera) shares their experience with the product, explaining why
they love it.

Why it works:

● Social proof builds trust —people are more likely to believe another customer
than a brand.
● Eliminates objections by showing someone with the same concerns who got
results.
● Authenticity drives conversions —UGC testimonials feel more relatable than
scripted ads.
Best for:

Any industry, but especially high-ticket products, B2B, SaaS, wellness, beauty, fitness,
and supplements.

Examples to test:

Face-to-Camera Review: A customer talks about their before/after experience
with the product.
Tweet + Video Combo: A real tweet or review screenshot with a creator reacting
to it.
Text Overlay Testimonial: A review appears on screen while the creator shows
the product in action.
11. Listicle
A creator lists three reasons why the product is a must-have, making the case in a
structured, easy-to-digest way.

Why it works:

● Gives viewers a clear, logical reason to buy.
● Works well for short-form content (quick and easy to consume).
● List-based content is engaging—people want to see if they agree with the points.
Best for:

Any product that solves a clear problem—SaaS, e-commerce, beauty, fitness, and
supplements.

Examples to test:

Pain-Point Driven: “3 reasons why your skincare routine isn’t working.”
Feature-Focused: “3 reasons why this laptop stand is a game-changer.”
Social Proof-Based: “3 reasons why 10,000+ people love this product.”
Negative : “3 reasons I hate doing [x]”
12. This vs That UGC
A side-by-side breakdown of your product vs. a competitor or an alternative solution. Or
a life before and life after.

Why it works:

● Frames your product as the better option without being overly aggressive.
● Addresses buyer hesitation by clearly showing why your product is worth it.
● Works well for new brands trying to compete against established companies.
Best for:

SaaS, subscription services, e-commerce, supplements, beauty, and any product with
direct competitors.

Examples to test:

Finding Creative Inspiration
No artist or creative does their work in a vacuum.

They all keep their eyes and ears open for things to inspire them.

Ad creatives are no different.

In fact, it's even more important because you're spending money to test ad creatives.
So you might as well try to remix winning formats so your money doesn't go to waste.

There are a few ways to gather inspiration:

● Ad channels themselves: The Meta Ad Library and LinkedIn Ad Library let you
peak at ads that any company is running.
● Creative inspiration tools: Tools like Foreplay and Atria let you browse a big
library of ads.
● Social media: Sometimes the best inspiration organically pops into your feed.
● Databases and galleries: Random sites have created databases of ads.
Let's dive into each of those now:

Creative inspiration tools
We'll start with creative inspiration tools because they not only help you discover great
ads, they also allow you to save great ads you stumble upon on social media and in the
ad libraries into boards.

You can then use those as inspiration boards for yourself, for your team, or for your
clients.

Here are the two tools we recommend:

● Foreplay: The tool we use internally with our agency to gather inspiration to use
internally and to share with clients.
● Atria : A competitor to Foreplay that also has some analytics tooling (at additional
cost).
Here's a walkthrough of how to use Foreplay:

Meta and LinkedIn Ad Libraries
Here are the links to the ad libraries:

● Meta Ad Library
● LinkedIn Ad Library
● Reddit Ad Library
These tools let you search for the ads being run by specific companies.

Here's a walkthrough of how to do just that:

If you decided to use Foreplay or Atria, then save any great ads you find to your boards.

Social media
How to tell you're a real marketer:

You specifically stop to watch the ads as you browse social media. AND you save the
ones you find interesting.

Whenever you're scrolling through Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, or wherever
take note of an ad that:

● Catches your attention
● Makes you stop scrolling
● Keeps you watching until the end
● Has you questioning whether you should click or not
● Or, is just creative or interesting
Then you can save the ads to Foreplay for future reference. You do that by forwarding
the ad to the Foreplay instagram account (assuming you linked your Instagram to your
Foreplay account).

Databases and galleries
Various websites or influencers out there have curated ads:

● Adfolio: Database of great b2b ads.
● Ads of the World: Ads from big brands.
● Commarts: Ads from big brands.
● The Ad Professor: An influencer who shares a lot of ad inspo
Great artists steal
Don't create in a vacuum.

Finding inspiration should always be a part of your creative process.

Ad Creative Safe Zones
One thing that is not often discussed or often considered by those making ad creatives,
are "safe zones."

Essentially, the safe parts of an ad creative to put key pieces of information.

Why does that matter?

Well, your beautiful Story is not seen like it is in a Photos app, Canva, or Figma.

It's instead viewed in the context of Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, or TikTok, where a
bunch of UI elements are layered on top of it.

Here's a great image from CreativeX that illustrates this quite well:

For the Reel on the left, look at all the visual elements like the brand name, button, text,
likes, comments, and shares that crowd the Reel. If you placed an important part of the
ad in the bottom half of the ad, it'd be completely covered.

Always be wary of these safe zones to ensure the focal point of your ads is where
it should be.

Introduction: Email Marketing
"I want to do business with a company that treats emailing me as a privilege, not a
transaction."

— Andrea Mignolo

Email marketing
The beauty of email marketing is that it takes a tool we all already use—our inbox—and
turns it into a channel for brand affinity and customer acquisition.

The best email marketing is permission-based, meaning that customers opt in to the
type of communication they want from you. If you play email right, customers will want
to hear from you—because you’re a friend in their inbox.

However, inboxes are overwhelming. As you read through this module, remember that
the best approach is a human one: Show subscribers that there are humans behind
your emails—people who truly want to help solve their problems.

Revenue follows trust.

How we got here
Email marketing evolved from direct mail marketing:

● Catalogs to get people to order products.
● Coupons to people to come into stores.
● Brochures to book sales calls for vacations.
● Magazines to build brand awareness.
But as email rose in popularity, it became more efficient to send campaigns to inboxes
instead of mailboxes.

After all, it costs money to send physical mail out to thousands of people.

The process hasn’t changed much from direct mail marketing: Send communication to
an audience that builds brand and generates revenue.

Only the medium has changed.

Why you need to learn email marketing
Collecting an email address goes a lot further than collecting, say, a Twitter follower.

Email is an owned channel

It’s great to grow a Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn following. But, with social media, only
a fraction of your audience will ever see your organic content. You’re at the mercy of an
algorithm that decides whether or not to surface your content.

Take a post on Instagram:

● Instagram surfaces your organic post to 10% of your followers.
● If it gets strong engagement, it goes to the next 10% of your followers. If it
doesn’t get strong enough engagement, Instagram stops surfacing your post.
With email, you're directly in subscribers’ inboxes. No gatekeepers.

Well, the only gatekeeper is how much they trust you. Whether you’ve proven you’re a
good use of their time.

Email is high ROI

Email is the most profitable marketing channel.

On average, email earns $40 for every $1 spent.

Why? Because it’s cheap to send emails and your best-converting customers are
people who already know who you are.

The next highest ROI channel is almost half as valuable: SEO with about $22 return for
every $1 spent.

Strategy and Types of Emails
Strategy
In its simplest form, here’s what a business’ email marketing strategy can look like:

An email campaign is one or more emails focused on a single, overall goal.

Goals can include:

● Increasing conversion
● Building brand trust
● Decreasing churn
● Driving engagement
These emails can take on different formats. Let's take a look at the different types of
emails.

Types of emails
There are two types of campaign distribution models: broadcasts and automated.

Broadcasts
Broadcasts are one-time emails you manually sent to your subscribers. Think:

● Newsletters—things that can’t be automated, like our Demand Curve newsletter
● Updates
● Special promotions
Automated
Automated campaigns are sent automatically when someone performs an action or a
certain amount of time has passed.

For example, you can receive transactional emails including receipts:

And you can receive welcome emails, cart abandonment emails, and hundreds of more
variations. Let’s cover a few:

Automated email flows

An email flow is a series of emails that move leads through your funnel.

Use flows to:

● Greet new subscribers and get them to immediately engage
● Nurture subscribers and get them to buy from you
● Win back subscribers who stopped engaging your emails
● Maintain a “clean” subscriber list to improve deliverability
Let’s cover the three flows that are essential for most businesses:

Welcome/onboarding
Nurture
Win-back
1. Welcome/onboarding
Welcome/onboarding flows drive customers to take their first meaningful action with
your business. The action could be around product usage, reading a piece of content, or
making a purchase.

Subscribers are more likely to take an action on your emails when they first sign up.
You’re still top of mind.

Here’s an example of the first email in a welcome flow.

Subject: Welcome! You’re one in a billion ⭐

Bite’s welcome gets a few things right:

● They introduce the brand (with an elegant, aspirational design)
● They showcase their mission: end plastic waste
● They immediately ask customers to purchase with a “Shop now” CTA
Bite goes for a purchase on their first email because their sales cycle is short—they’re
selling toothpaste, not enterprise SaaS.

2. Nurture

Nurture flows are focused on providing value and, in return, turning subscribers into
customers.

Here’s the Demand Curve email we showed you earlier in the CTA section:

Subject: “More growth resources”

Notice that the goal of the email is to provide as much value as possible. We offer three
free resources to subscribers. There’s no attempt to monetize with this specific
email—we simply want our subscribers to find the resources valuable.

That way, when we send a marketing email down the road, customers are more likely to
have affinity for Demand Curve. They’re more likely to purchase. They know we know
our stuff.

3. Win-back

Win-back campaigns help you recover leads who are stuck in your funnel. There will
always be a percentage of subscribers who don’t engage with your emails after a
certain stage. Win-back flows entice customers to come back.

Examples include seeding promotions, highlighting new features, or providing a unique
incentive that is valuable enough to move subscribers to the next stage of your funnel.

Noom used a steep discount to win-back unengaged subscribers.

Subject: “Come back to get your Custom Plan for up to 90% Off”

The subject line, “Come back” and the header, “Don’t wait to reclaim your health” meet
unengaged customers at their stage of the buyer’s journey with Noom—most of them
haven’t opened or engaged with emails in a while. The tactical copy above combined
with the steep discount likely win-back customers who would otherwise simply drop out
of the funnel completely.

Use case examples for email flows
Let’s take a look at how different startups apply these email flows in practice. We'll take
a look at a few product types:

SaaS, mobile apps, chrome extensions
Ecommerce
1. SaaS, mobile apps, chrome extensions
Onboarding : Since product adoption and usage is critical, welcome flows for most
SaaS, apps, and chrome extensions are educational. They work best when they explain
how the product works and highlight benefits to users.

Here’s how Headspace does it. The goal of the email below is to educate subscribers
so that they start using the app.

Subject: “Where will meditation take you?”

Headspace provides education in their onboarding email, providing information about
when to use the app, and how science supports meditation. The included CTA reads
“Start with basics” which is Headspace’s freemium meditation offering.

They want early engagement so that they can get people onboarding and enjoying the
product—they’ll upsell users later.

Nurture: Nurture flows turn subscribers and free users into paying customers.
Promotions are effective here. Let’s take a look at one of Calm’s nurture campaigns
below:

Subject: “Your exclusive discount on a lifetime of Calm”

Calm’s nurture campaign meets users where they’re at—it’s triggered after people start
using Calm’s free product. See, Calm knows when customers are engaged, and they
use their nurture flow to upsell and generate revenue from subscribers.

Win-back: target subscribers who were actively using your product but stopped
recently. Invite them back by highlighting new features.

Here are examples from Asana and Grammarly.

Subject: “Since you’ve been gone...”

Here’s why Asana’s win-back email works:

● The subject, “Since you’ve been gone...” is relevant to the subscriber because
they haven’t been engaging Asana’s emails in some time. It gets people to click.
● The line, “We haven’t seen you in a while. Is it us?” is witty and relatable.
● Highlighting the fact that Asana improved and is now 2x faster is enough to
recover a strong percentage of customers.
Here's another example. Grammarly’s email is a properly-executed win-back campaign.

Subject: “You’ve Earned a New Badge!”

Here’s what Grammarly gets right:

● The subject, “You’ve earned a new badge” is enough to incentivize subscribers to
click—they’re hit with a dopamine hit when they’re acknowledged for doing
something productive.
● Lines like, “back when you were into writing things on the Internet” and “Then you
just disappeared” are both light-hearted and relatable for subscribers who’ve
been ghosting.
● The big red “GO!” button is a refreshing CTA. It gets people to click and
reengage with Grammarly.
Moving on, let's take a look at how Ecommerce companies approach emails.

2. Ecommerce

Welcome: in ecom, the best welcome flows move people towards purchase of their
product. Typically, the initial email introduces your brand and showcases how you can
help them. The ensuing emails highlight features and benefits of the product, handle
relevant objections, and go for purchase.

Here’s an example from Casper.

Subject: “Welcome to Casper”

Here’s what Casper gets right:

● Social proof by adding a note that the subscriber is joining a community of 1
million people.
● “Let’s get sleepy” CTA is witty and clickable
● Subscribers benefits showcases immediate value
● Sleep tip is a smart way to build trust
● 20% discount gets people to shop
Nurture: Nurture flows in ecom focus on building a brand moat, and turning customers
into repeat buyers. LTV is the name of the game. So they often include upsells, new
product launches, referral programs, and targeted promotions to incentivize purchase.

Here’s an example from Harry’s

Subject: “Small steps for a smoother shave”

Harry’s nurture email comes in a flow after a welcome email. The text, “A grown man’s
guide to getting a baby face” is on-brand. Think about the business of DTC ecom (like
shaving)—it’s an LTV game.

Harry’s email:

Educates subscribers on how to properly pre-shave.
Executes #1 in a brand voice that helps dig a brand moat
Both improve LTV for Harry’s.

Win-back: Win back flows in ecom are similar to those in software—it’s about
reengaging subscribers who are stuck at a certain point in the funnel. Personalization
can help here to catch inactive subscribers’ attention and move them towards purchase.

You’ll recognize our Blue Apron email below from our section on subject lines.

Subject line: “Come on back - we made dinner easier! 😋”

● Blue Apron’s subject alone helps win back customers
● The phrase, “Come on back” clearly indicates that they’re speaking directly to the
segment that is getting this flow—those who haven’t been engaging emails
● They include a $30 coupon in their CTA, which is a brilliant way to incentivize
customers who are on the fringe of ghosting.
Bonus: try adding a touch of personalization in the subject line by including the
subscriber’s first name. This isn’t something to use in all flows, but it can be effective in
win-back campaigns since it captures the eye and generally gets more people to click.

How to grow your list
"A small list that wants exactly what you’re offering is better than a bigger list that isn’t
committed."

— Ramsay Leimenstoll

First, to set our priorities: you’re not just looking for email addresses. What you want is a
list of people who increasingly trust you and want to buy from you.

You’re not going for a volume play. You're going for a quality and trust play. People get
too many emails for another catch-all volume play to stand out in their inbox.

Lead gen items
The most effective way to get signups for your email list is to create a lead gen asset.
This is a valuable resource that you provide to leads in exchange for their email.

The key is to provide a large amount of value up front to make would-be subscribers
think, “Wow, all I have to do is give you my email and I get more of THIS?”

Your asset has to be something that attracts people likely to buy from you.
Remember, quality over quantity, and that starts with your lead gen asset: What
do the people who can pay you most want?

For example, if your startup sells coffee, don’t make your lead gen an entry to win a trip
to the Bahamas. Instead, make it a lifetime supply of free coffee. That way you’ll only
attract people who actually like coffee.

If you’re an ecommerce startup, these types of lead gen pitches typically work best:

If you’re in SaaS, apps, or other online products, try these:

Webinars

Educational content like playbooks and free courses

Access to exclusive communities, like Slack groups

Popups
The lead gen item is the carrot. Once someone bites, you need a way to grab their
email.

Here are two ways to capture emails:

Basic subscribe boxes

Popups

Popups copy

First, a few thoughts on how to write these email capture elements well:

Perfect your header

Header copy needs to include a tangible benefit for the visitor. Instead of explaining
what people get when they sign up, show them the outcome. This is a basic tenet of
good copywriting, and it applies equally to email capture.

For example, change the copy “ Sign up to get my free 7-day course” to “Improve your
emotional intelligence in just 7 days.”

Add social proof

When a lead sees other people—people like them—leaving glowing testimonials for
your product, there’s a higher chance they’ll convert.

For example, include a testimonial with a photo of a person who fits your target
audience. Help people see themselves in your marketing material:

● If you’re in martech, get a testimonial from a Head of Growth or VP of marketing.
● If you’re a direct to consumer fitness brand, try getting a testimonial from a
well-known athlete.
Change your call to action (CTA)

Write CTA copy that is value-driven. People are more likely to enter their email and click
if your CTA is an action that provides them value.

For example, change “Subscribe” to “Send me lesson 1”.

Dynamic Popups

If you want to take popups a step further, try this: use dynamic popups to meet visitors
at their current stage in the buyer's journey. Most marketing messaging tools offer the
ability to target individuals with customized popups.

For example, split your audience into three segments and show a distinct popup that
resonates with each:

First time traffic
For first time visitors who haven’t subscribed yet, provide a discount, a
giveaway, or exclusive content gated by an email capture.
Returning subscribers
For those who haven’t purchased and are coming back to browse again,
make your lead gen asset a subscriber-only discount to encourage a
purchase. Include a countdown timer to create urgency.
Customers
For existing customers, feature new products and greet people with a
"welcome back" message to let them know they’re part of the family now.
Important Metrics
Open rate fallacy
One of the most common mistakes we see in email marketing is judging the quality of
an email solely by open rate.

Open rate is actually unrelated to the content of that specific email—people haven’t
seen inside it yet.

Nonetheless, it’s your first impression and you want to optimize it. We’ll touch on this in
a moment.

Click-through rate (CTR)
CTR measures the percentage of recipients who click any link within your email. That’s
a more meaningful metric of how well your email is resonating than purely its open rate.

Tip: To make this metric even more meaningful, focus on the number of people who
click after opening—this will exclude people for whom the subject wasn’t appealing.

Ways to improve CTR:

● Segment emails so the different types of buyer personas see what most appeals
to them. We’ll cover this shortly.
● Have one clear goal per email.
● Use a call to value instead of a call to action—call to value means replacing your
generic CTAs with clear value. Think of a cooking supplies site that sends out an
email with a link to a blog post. Change the “Read the blog post here” button with
a “Learn exactly how to make sourdough”
Open reach
Open reach is a proxy for email engagement. It’s the number of subscribers who open
at least one of your emails over the number of subscribers who received at least one
email from you, over a period of time (say, 30 days).

Not everyone will open all of your emails. So instead of using open rate, which is on an
email to email basis, use open reach to determine how many of your subscribers
engage with at least one of your emails in the last measurement period.

How to Create a Good Email
When creating emails to send to subscribers, we care about what gets people to take
action.

Subject line
Your subject line needs to be:

● Appealing : Have a hook; avoid blending in with other emails.
● Concise : 50 characters or less is best for mobile.
● Self-evident : Don’t make people guess why you’re bugging them.
Here’s an email that was sent shortly after using the Chipotle (restaurant) app without
ordering. It’s short and to the point, and our eyes gravitate to the gift emoji. It’s
appealing because it’s clear that there’s a reward inside—that gets the click.

This Strava email was sent after a morning bike ride. The short, flattering subject is
enticing, and I’m immediately interested in my ride details. I open the email because I
know I’ll receive a dopamine hit with a notification and positive data about my ride.

Freehand Hotels sent this email before a long holiday weekend. The subject is concise,
and they quickly flash a deal: 30% off. If I’m at all considering a long trip, the 30%
discount in the subject is enough to get me to open the email.

Here’s another simple, self-evident subject line from Point. 5x points on purchases at
Apple until October 22nd. I click because I know exactly what’s inside.

Design
Once people open your email, they’ll reflexively decide if they’re going to read it, skim it,
or bounce (and archive).

Your design needs to be simple, elegant, and clear. Use a clean design that includes
plenty of negative space. Use a standard typeface with large-ish typography and make
it easy on the eyes.

Every now and then, run outlier experiments. Break these rules and see if you can find
something that’s out of the box and gets people to lean in because it looks like nothing
else in their inbox:

GDFA gets away with experimenting with a unique design (no images, harsh language)
because it leans heavily into their counter-culture brand.

The best outlier marketing is always brand consistent—otherwise it feels desperate.

Body copy
Your email’s body copy serves a specific purpose: drive people to take action on your
CTA.

Here’s what typically works best:

● Be aggressively concise. Don’t waste your subscribers’ time with unwarranted
fluff.
● Fulfill the expectation you set in your subject line: deliver on your promise.
● Promise even more value that is only delivered when subscribers click your CTA.
● Show social proof so that subscribers see the huge value that their peers got
from you.
Here’s an example.

Subject line: “Welcome to Casper”

What Casper nails:

● Subject dictates that it is a welcome email. The body fulfills that promise.
● Concise single paragraph—no fluff.
● Social proof highlights a community of 1 million well-rested sleepers.
● “Let’s get sleepy” CTA promises that Casper solves for a better night’s sleep.
What Casper can improve:

● Offer a more specific value prop that would motivate users to click more.
By default, focus on one goal per email
Most of your emails should only include one CTA. If you include more than one CTA,
you run the risk of distracting subscribers from the goal of your email.

● Marketing emails with a promotion should drive people to purchase.
● Nurture emails should get people to read a single blog post about a relevant
topic.
The CTA(s) in your emails should drive people to that goal.

But, for certain welcome emails, it’s okay to break this rule and include multiple CTAs to
give people a “Choose your own adventure” experience. For example, our Demand
Curve email drip contains a nurture email that includes multiple CTAs:

● Watch our masterclasses
● Hire an agency
● Get discounts on tools, etc.
That’s okay because the single goal of the email is to allow subscribers to self-select
what they’re most interested in (which we use for segmentation). We need to introduce
people to the Demand Curve ecosystem.

Legal Stuff
Lastly, don’t forget the legal considerations.

You’re legally required to include an unsubscribe button on every email. You’ll also need
to send email from a valid email address attached to your domain name.

Don’t overlook this. Aside from ensuring that you don’t break the law, legal best
practices improve email deliverability—meaning your emails wind up in more inboxes.
We’ll cover this later in the Deliverability Best Practices chapter.

How to use Segmentation
At this point we’ve covered:

● Capturing subscribers
● Writing emails
● Email flows and when to use them
There’s a remaining nuance we need to address.

Everyone on your email list is different.

Since each person is at a different stage of their relationship with your startup, it doesn’t
make sense to blast them all with the same emails.

That’s where segmentation comes in.

What is segmentation?
Segmentation involves splitting your list into groups based on data you get from
subscribers.

Then your email flows come into play to automatically deliver the right message to the
right person at the right time.

You can automate all of your segmentation with simple if/then statements.

● Say you own an online pet supplies store:
○ If someone opens an email and clicks on the link to a resource titled, “best
dog beds of 2020”, then they get added to the ‘dog owners’ email flow.
● Imagine you run a B2B SaaS product with a freemium model:
○ If someone uses your product each day for 5 days in a row, then they’re
added to a “high potential” nurture sequence that goes for an upsell.
The benefits of segmentation include:

Increased performance (and in turn, revenue)
Increased email deliverability, (which is what our next section covers in detail).
Proper segmentation can result in increased open rates and CTRs, and decreased
spam reports and unsubscribe rates.

In fact, marketers generate 760% more email revenue from segmented campaigns.
760%. That’s not a typo.

Here’s how you can create a segmentation system:

Set goals
Create groups
Automate data capture and execution
Write emails for each segment
1. Set goals
What’s the goal of your segmentation? To sell a product? To get people to download an
app?

The answer to this question will guide your segmentation strategy. You can create
segments that will help collect the data necessary to split your list properly to achieve
your goal.

Here’s an example:

If your goal is to sell more products, you might want to segment out high purchase intent
subscribers—you can capture data on email open rate, and CTR to focus only on your
most engaged potential customers.

2. Create groups
Create your segmentation groups to accomplish the goals you set above.

Here are some of the most effective ways to split your list:

2a. Demographics

It’s common practice to group based on demographic data, like age, gender, etc.
Demographic groups work best for businesses that sell different products to different
groups of customers—like a clothing store who sells women’s and men’s clothing.

2b. Email engagement and behavior

You can split your list by how actively they engage your emails. Say you want to filter
out high purchase intent subscribers and send them specific messages that get them to
convert. You can split based on engagement metrics like open rate and CTR.

You can also split your list by email engagement. Try sending an email with multiple
options and segmenting based on which one subscribers click.

Here’s an example from Brooks:

Brooks sends this email early on in a flow. They ask subscribers to select what they’re
most interested in. Their response gives Brooks useful data that allows them to
segment properly. If a subscriber clicks on the male trail runner photo, then they’ll enter
a flow that caters to this persona.

2c. Website behavior

What people look at on your site can tell you all that you need to know about what
they’re looking for. Splitting your list based on site activity is interest-based
segmentation.

For example, take abandoned cart emails: shoppers often add an item to their cart and
bounce without purchasing. The act of adding an item to the cart can trigger an
abandoned cart email and split the shopper into a high purchase intent group for
retargeting.

2d. Funnel stage

Try splitting your list by stage of the funnel— those who just discovered you vs. those
who are considering buying from you a second time.

Here are a few metrics to look at that will help you split by funnel stage:

● Amount of time on your email list
● Amount of time since last purchase
● Email stats like open rate and CTR
● Number of page views
Your email automation tool (like Customer.io or Mailchimp) will help you set up flows
based on the funnel stage metrics above.

Here’s an example flow:

Customer signs up for your email list
They click a blog post
They hit 5 page views
You send another email to them instead of waiting a full week
3. Automate data capture and execution
Good data is non-negotiable when you’re segmenting. The data you collect determines
how you split your list. Without data, you have no way to group subscribers and deliver
personalized messages.

Almost all data collection can be done within your ESP. For more complicated data
collection, you might need a CRM like Hubspot, which stores more data about your
subscribers than standard ESPs like Mailchimp, Drip, or Customer.io.

There are two types of data that you’ll want to know: implicit and explicit.

Implicit data is information you gather from subscriber behavior or your analytics tools.
Think what pages subscribers use, and what resources they download.

Explicit data is information your subscribers give you directly, like their name, DOB,
and address. You can typically get explicit data by form submissions or surveying your
audience.

Best practice: Since people generally don’t like filling out forms, ask only what’s critical
and use implicit data for the rest.

4. Write emails for each segment
This is where you go to work using everything you learned early about writing great
emails. Create all of your emails in advance for each segment within your ESP.

Once finished, you’ll have an automated email engine that will be working on your
behalf 24/7.

Email deliverability = good
fundamentals.
Not sneaky tactics.

If you have a few hundred, thousand, or even a few tens of thousands of
subscribers and you send once a week, email deliverability should not be a
primary concern.

Writing really good emails and newsletters (and growing it) should be.

The reason is complicated, and I’ll get into it, but for now, know that if you’re a startup
with less than 50,000 or 100,000 subscribers and aren’t sending super frequently, then
a lot of the fancier email deliverability stuff won’t really apply.

But, what matters for everyone?
The most important thing you can do for deliverability and overall newsletter health and
growth is to ensure that people consistently:

Open your emails
Click on links in your emails
Reply to your emails
Stay subscribed
And don’t mark your emails as spam
These are really the most important things—and the hardest to achieve.

Clever hacks will not make up for “meh” or spammy content.

The best way to achieve those things is to:

Consistently make it one of their favorite newsletters.
Not bombard them with so many emails they can’t keep up.
Remove people who aren’t engaged anymore.
Let people unsubscribe if they want to (so they don’t mark you as spam).
Someone should be excited to see your emails in their inbox and then open and
read them.

If you fail to do that, you are not only shouting into the void, but your deliverability will
decline over time. And all the “clever tricks” won’t help you.

Beyond that, you want to make sure you’re not sending emails to:

People who don’t want it and can’t unsubscribe
People who are not opening or clicking your emails anymore
Broken, invalid, or abandoned email addresses
Spam traps (more on this later)
Low-quality email addresses (ones with poor reputations)
Before I give more specific and general advice, let’s get some of the foundational stuff
out of the way:

How does email deliverability work?
And why does it matter?

Good email deliverability enables your emails to land in recipients’ inboxes, something
known as inbox placement.

This journey isn’t as straightforward as you might think. Here’s what happens whenever
you send an email through an email platform:

You click send.
Most of your emails are sent. Some are suppressed—they’re prevented from
being sent to recipients based on previous activity, like a hard bounce or spam
complaint from that specific user.
Most of your sent emails are delivered, except for those that soft bounced or hard
bounced.
1. A soft bounce means an email couldn’t be delivered because of
temporary reasons. A few examples: The recipient’s inbox is already full;
their mail server has an issue; or your message was too big for the
recipient’s inbox.
2. A hard bounce happens when you send an email to a mailbox that
doesn’t exist. This could be because someone entered their email
incorrectly, they used a fake email, or they changed jobs and the email no
longer exists.
Your delivered emails can then go in one of a few directions:
They arrive in the recipient’s inbox—these are the emails that count
toward your campaign’s deliverability rate.
They land in the recipient’s spam or junk folder. This is dictated by an
algorithm and is based on your sender reputation and the contents for
your email.
They fall into a spam trap. These are fake email addresses used by ISPs
and blacklist providers to catch unethical email marketers.
They’re blocked completely by an ISP due to high rates of spam to other
email addresses managed by that ISP.
Wait what’s an ISP? Well here are two acronyms to understand:

● Internet Service Provider (ISP) : The companies that not only give people
internet access but also provide mailboxes, like Gmail, Outlook, Comcast, and
Yahoo. You can think of ISPs as inbox gatekeepers. They decide if you get into
the inbox.
● Email Service Provider (ESP): Tools marketers use to send emails to their
subscribers. Think Mailchimp, Klayvio, ConvertKit, Substack, Beehiiv,
Customer.io, and Drip.
Why it matters less if you have a smaller
list
For basically all ESPs (Email Service Providers), unless you have a massive list and
send a ton of emails, they’re almost certainly sending your emails on what are called
“Shared IP Pools.”

Essentially, the email provider sends your emails using the same server they use to
send other customer’s emails.

If you have a large list and send millions or billions of emails, you’ll generally shift to
have a “Dedicated IP,” meaning there’s a specific server that sends on your behalf.

So on a Shared IP pool, the reputation of the server is not just impacted by you, it’s
impacted by every other customer that is using that ESP.

There are some benefits to this:

To maintain a good reputation you need to be sending at least tens to hundreds
of thousands of emails per week. So if you’re below these large thresholds it’s
better to be lumped together.
If you’re going to send an email to promote your product, it’s great to use the
Shared IP Pool since any negative feedback you might receive will be directed at
that shared pool instead of your own. (More on this later.)
You’re not solely responsible for the reputation so it’s less important to do things
perfectly.
But it’s not that simple.

It’s safe to assume that the email tool is monitoring your email’s activities. And that they
may have Shared IP Pools with better reputations than others. And that they’d send
emails on behalf of their best customers using their best IP pools.

And if you’re getting a lot of spam complaints or hard bounces, they may just remove
you from their platform entirely.

So it’s still worth taking it seriously. Just less so than if you have a Dedicated IP.

General advice for everyone
With that out of the way, let’s dive into both general and nuanced advice for everyone
(regardless of list size).

After that, I’ll give some advice for people on Dedicated IP pools (again, ~100,000+
subscribers.)

Everyone should do this:
● Try to make your newsletter someone’s favourite
● Make sure your emails are optimized for desktop and mobile
● Survey people in each newsletter edition and improve it based on feedback.
These links take them to a super quick Typeform survey:
○ Some email tools have native ‘polls’ features that allows you to gather
feedback directly.
● Encourage replies by asking questions
● Make it easy for people to unsubscribe in every email
● Allow people to unsubscribe to certain types of emails (promotions, drip emails,
product-specific emails, etc).
● Write compelling copy that encourages clicks
● Periodically or automatically remove people who:
○ Have received > 20 emails without opening
○ Have had emails hard bounce
● Don’t slam your list with constant promotions. Treat it with care.
● Only email people who have consented to receive them.
○ Do not buy email lists
● Segment your audience list and send emails to those most likely to find it
valuable. For example, they’re in a specific funnel, have clicked on certain pages,
have purchased certain products, or fit the intended target demographic (you’ll
need to ask for that data).
● Use email validation tools like Kickbox to verify that an email is valid, deliverable,
and decent quality before actually subscribing people to your list.
● Give single opt-in a chance if you’re willing to practice good list hygiene.
More on that last point in a second.

Specific advice for everyone
Now the more nuanced stuff.

Single vs double opt-in
A lot of people will advise that you should only subscribe someone to your newsletter if
they confirm the subscription by clicking a “confirm link” in the welcome email.

This is a great way to ensure only people who want it get it. Therefore, it’s a good way
to ensure you have a better sender reputation over time.

But a decent chunk of people who want it will never get around to opening that welcome
email and clicking the button.

So it’s a trade-off : Growth vs deliverability

Here’s the recommendation:

If you will periodically monitor your email metrics, use email validation (more on
this later), and clean your list to remove problem folks (bouncing, not opening,
etc), then single opt-in will help grow your email list faster.
Double opt-in is the safe bet if you’d rather just focus on writing good emails.
💡 What we do is we use the email validation tool below. We only add people if
they’re considred “deliverable.” And if the email address is from a low-ish quality
provider like yahoo, aol, or hotmail (which are commonly used in spam attacks),
we require double opt-in. For most other users we just do single opt-in and purge
accordingly.

Email validation
One great way to keep your list clean is to use an email validation tool like Kickbox.

It’ll spit out whether the email is deliverable (it’s not fake or broken), whether it’s “low
quality” and whether it’s likely a spam trap.

You can then only subscribe someone if they pass that bar.

It does cost money, so if you’re on a tight budget:

You can YOLO it and send emails to anyone who subscribes.

For anyone who is not opening their emails, you can just run them through Kickbox to
see why.

Segment out weird emails
You can create segments or filters for things like:

● Common misspellings/typos : gmail.co, gmail.con. neal@gmail.con
● Invalid emails : No @ or .com. neal@gmail
● Admin inboxes : Like help@ or info@ or contact@. help@gmail.com
● Test emails: test@, test.com, abcd@, 123@
Or you can just manually go through the list to see stuff like that.

Then you can unsubscribe them or just not send to them.

Sunset segment + win-back campaign
If someone goes 20+ emails or a few months of receiving your emails without opening
or clicking them, you should consider unsubscribing them.

You should create automatic/manual segments in your ESP for people who fall into this
camp.

Before you unsubscribe them, you should try a win-back campaign —one where you
email them specifically trying to get them to open, click, or reply to your emails.

We do this in a 5 email sequence (trying various different subject lines, senders, and
angles) where the whole goal is to get them to open and click. For example:

If someone goes the whole 5 emails without opening or clicking, we remove them from
our lists.

Dedicated IP Stuff
Below are things you can only do if you have Dedicated IP and want to get really
complicated. Definitely wait until you have 50,000 or even 100,000 plus subscribers to
add this complexity.

Warming it up
When you start a dedicated IP, you can’t just start blasting off your 100,000 subscriber
newsletter right away since you have zero reputation. Email providers will immediately
halt you.

Instead, you need to slowly warm it up. Start off by sending 200 emails and double
volume each day (200, 400, 800, etc.).

Luckily email tools will often help by doing this on your behalf in the back-end.

Custom Subdomain
If you’re sending a newsletter, marketing drips, promotional emails, and transactional
emails (purchase confirmation), then you’ll likely want separate Dedicated IPs for each
one.

To do this, you’ll want to create separate subdomains for each one. For example, for a
long time we did:

● Newsletter : n.demandcurve.com (dedicated)
● Marketing (drip emails) : m.demandcurve.com (dedicated)
● Transactional : t.demandcurve.com (we actually have this on a shared
Transactional Pool from our email tool that has really high deliverability)
● Promotional : e.demandcurve.com (shared IP)
● Covert emails : demandcurve.com (shared IP). This is for emails I want to make
it look like I actually sent them manually.
Note, now we made it more simple and just use shared IP. So we only recommend
above if you're a very high volume sender.

That way the reputation of the newsletter is not damaged by the reputation of the
promotional emails or marketing emails.

To do this you’ll need to set up DNS records for each subdomain. Most email tools will
walk you through this process as they need to give you the specific data to add to the
DNS records.

Email authentication
Whenever you send an email, ISPs check the IP address to see where it came from and
to confirm that your IP has permission to send emails from your domain.

The point of this is email authentication , which helps ISPs prevent fraudulent email
activity like phishing attacks.

Email authentication is a must when using an email tool to send messages on behalf of
your custom domain. It involves a few protocols:

● Sender Policy Framework (SPF) lets senders define which IP addresses can
send mail for a particular domain.
● DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) attaches a digital signature to outgoing
emails to confirm that messages aren’t fake or edited.
● DMARC builds off of SPF and DKIM for extra security. It lets email senders
specify to receiving servers how to deal with emails that don’t pass the other
methods of authentication—like send them to the junk folder or block them.
Some ESPs automatically provide authentication. For example, any domains bought
through Mailchimp have DKIM enabled by default; but if you got your domain through
another provider, you’ll need to set it up. Ultimately, how authentication works depends
on your chosen ESP.

Fortunately, most ESPs offer clear instructions to walk you through the process. Here
are resources from a few of the biggest ones:

● Mailchimp
● Campaign Monitor
● ConvertKit
● Customer.io
● Drip
● HubSpot
● Klaviyo
● Rejoiner
Again, focus on the fundamentals
That’s really the 80/20 to email deliverability. Here’s a quick recap:

The most important

Make amazing content that people love
Stay focused on a particular topic/audience (if you hard pivot then you’re
emailing people who don’t care about this new topic)
Don’t send so often that people can’t keep up
Only email people that want to be emailed by you
Treat your email list with care and don’t hammer them with promotions. Be
sparing and segment your email list so you only hit those interested in
something.
Survey your audience and keep writing better and better emails.
Once you’ve done that then:

Practice good list hygiene
Remove invalid, low-quality, or bouncing emails
Remove unengaged folks
Do email validation
Worry about the single vs double opt-in strategy
And once you have a really large list then:

Switch to Dedicated IP and warm it up
Create numerous subdomains for different purposes
Overview
The goal of this project is for you to do a teardown of your company's email marketing
strategy (or create one for the first time).

Phase 1: Map out email strategy
Make a Dropbox Paper/Google doc.

For your company, given the top actions you think a user could take in the first 1-2 days,
map out the top 3-5 emails, texts, or notifications you’d send based on the key actions
(e.g. signup, cart abandonment, no site visit for two days, etc.)

For each, specify:

When will the email/notification be sent? (i.e. what triggers it? when will it be sent
after that trigger happens?)
Your general approach to the copy.
Your approach to the design (e.g., should the email be minimalist/mainly text?
are there specific visual elements that need to be present?)
Why do you feel this email/notification is critical and what you’re trying to
accomplish with it?
1. Add the major KPIs (metrics) that you'd improve by sending this
email/notification. Some examples:
1. Shorten time between signing up and adding to cart
2. Reduce churn rate
3. Increase number of monthly event attendees
Phase 2: Email copywriting
Pick three of the emails you specced out. Write the email. This will include:

The subject line
The body of the email
The email signature (if applicable)
Any CTAs
And don’t forget other details like:
Where the emails should link, if you include a link (e.g. which landing
page? where in the product? etc.)
Opt-out messaging
Who the email will be sent from
Any personalization you may want to include.
Phase 3: Set up tooling
If you don't already use a marketing tool, then Mailchimp, Customer.io, and
ActiveCampaign are great options.

Introduction: Google Ads
In this module, you’ll learn...
● What SEM and display marketing are
● How to use Google Ads to grow your business
● How to properly structure your Google Ads setup
● How to do keyword research
● How to optimize campaigns over time
Overview
Google Ads is one of the two largest ad channels. Only Meta (Facebook and Instagram)
is nearly as effective.

It’s also one of the most consistently profitable channels.

Google Ads has a few very different types of campaigns. It has...

Search ads

The bread and butter of Google. Ads that display along with organic results as people
search on Google.

Performance Max

As AI gets smarter, the algorithms that decide who gets served what ad, when, and
where, is increasingly better left in the hands of the machine that has insane amounts of
data on each user.

Performance Max is an automated campaign that you feed a bunch of copy and
creative, and then it goes and serves it to people when and where it sees fit, across
Search, Display, YouTube, and Discover.

These are great, but best to do after you already have >$5k/mo and have quite a
bit of conversion data. AI needs data to do its job, and a fresh account spending
$100/day just isn't enough for it to know what to do.

Display ads

Banner ads that display on sites and within apps that enable them

We'll be focusing on these in the context of Performance Max.

YouTube ads

Video ads on YouTube and on sites and within apps that enable them.

We'll be focusing on these in the context of Performance Max.

Shopping ads

Ecommerce product ads that display alongside search results and link directly to
product pages.

Universal app campaign

An automated campaign similar to Performance Max that runs ads automatically across
Search, Display, and YouTube ads. The only difference is that the goal is to drive people
directly to the App and Play Stores to download your mobile app.

How we'll teach Google Ads
Google Ads is massive.

We will focus on Search in this module since it’s what we'd recommend starting
with in 95% of cases. Most of what you learn when setting it up applies to the other
types.

Beyond that, we'll explore Performance Max to make full use of Google's algorithm to
automate Display, Search, and YouTube in one campaign.

Then if you'll launch Shopping if you're an ecomm business, and Universal App
Campaigns if you run a mobile app.

But for now, let's dive into Search Ads.

Module structure
Due to the complexity and size of Google Ads, we’ll build your Google Ads account
using a series of smaller projects, getting progressively more advanced and
fine-grained.

First, we’ll introduce a topic and dive into its details. Then, we’ll apply those lessons to
your account in a project.

After that, we’ll review more advanced concepts to apply over time as your account
grows.

In the first project, we’ll build and improve a simple account from there.

You could write ads and start running them immediately after the first project, but we
suggest waiting. If you kick everything off early, don’t judge performance too harshly
until you finish the very end of the module.

Client story
One of our previous clients is Framer, a tool for designers similar to Figma that let's you
prototype apps and build websites using AI.

They previously ran Google Ads with little success. When we came in and built out a
comprehensive strategy involving Search, Display, and YouTube, we could drive tens of
thousands of downloads per month across the three channels — often for only a few
dollars per sign up.

This was a massive win since they had never seen any success from paid acquisition
efforts.

We can tell a similar story for many of our clients (some making millions a month).
Hopefully, we can tell a similar one about you.

Mark Incomplete

Introduction: Search Ads
This guide will give you 90% of the foundational knowledge of Search Ads you
need to be successful. Let's dive in.

There are ~8 .5 billion searches on Google every day.

Without Search ads, only the most mature and established companies would get any
traffic from Google searches since they’d have the most content and history to win the
top search results.

Search ads let new companies and products buy the top slot on Google — until they
can get there themselves with time, SEO, and good content.

Being in the top results matters. Some estimates say 95.3% of clicks go to the top 4
results.

Organic search results (meaning, search results that aren’t ads) still get more most
clicks than paid results—although that continues to decrease as Google gets
increasingly aggressive with ads and more queries are resolved by AI>

But it depends on the type of search: For high-commercial intent searches — which
we care about the most — such as searches including the word “buy,” paid ads get
twice as many clicks (65%) as organic results do.

Search ads are an absolute must-test for almost any business.

Keywords
At its core, Search ads work by targeting keywords. Keywords are triggered by the
words people use in their searches. For example, if you are trying to sell organic
supplements, you may have keywords like the following:

● buy supplements
● organic supplements
● healthy supplements
● buy organic supplements
Then when someone googles something related to those keywords (such as best
organic supplements ), your ads can be shown right above the organic results. Whether
your ads do get shown is a different conversation.

Note: “Keyword ” is confusing since a single keyword can include several words. The
four examples above are each considered a keyword.

What Search ads are best for
This is a great graph that illustrates which companies Search ads (SEM) are best for:

You'll see Google SEM as the big bubble in the top middle.

In short, because people need to be searching on Google, they need to be aware
of the problem and in search of a solution.

For Search ads, you’re targeting almost entirely based on what someone is Googling,
with only basic location, demographic, device, and language targeting.

This is called intent-based targeting.

You’re marketing to people who show intent and interest in your product (by searching
for something related to it).

On other ad channels, like Meta, X, TikTok, or LinkedIn, you’re targeting people based
on things like their interests, job titles, likes, whether they’re a parent, whether they’re
traveling, their operating system, where they grew up, and more.

This is demographic-based or interest-based targeting.

You’re showing ads to them for products that you assume will interest them, even
though they aren’t explicitly showing any interest in them.

This is why you see Google SEM firmly in the "customer is actively looking for a product
like mine" and the other ad channels are firmly in the "customer is NOT actively looking
for a product like mine."

With this in mind, Search Ads work best for...

Brands, products, and product categories that people know and

understand, and are acutely feeling the pain of

Because you’re at the mercy of people searching for terms related to your product, you
rely on people knowing that they have a problem and that a solution may exist.

As a result, brand new and innovative products/product categories, or those that are just
"nice to haves" will not perform as well since people are not actively searching for them.

People with high intent to buy

If someone knows they want to purchase, and are just looking for the best option, they
are the ideal person to hit with a Search ad because they are searching for the solution
your product provides.

That's why keywords that signal high intent ("landscaper near me") cost more to target
than ones that are very generic or signal someone isn't ready to buy "free lawn care
tips."

You can target people looking for terms like “best X” or “buy X,” or even your
competitors’ names, to intercept people with high intent.

Capturing people from other ad channels

This is an extremely common flow:

● Day 0: Browsing Instagram, gets shown an ad for a product, scrolls past
● Day 4: Get hit with a different ad on Instagram and clicks it
● Day 6: Yet another ad on Instagram, scrolls past and thinks
● Day 6: Googles the company name
When someone clicks or sees an ad on Instagram/Facebook, they often end up
googling (either immediately or a few hours or days later) the name of your
brand/product or your product category to find similar products or reviews.

Having paid Search ads increases your presence as they do these searches, increasing
the likelihood of getting their sale instead of your competitors. In fact, Display and
YouTube ads often lead to conversions from people seeing the ad and later googling the
product—and not direct clicks on the ad.

Account structure
Thanks to advancing AI, the optimal way to structure Google Ads accounts has
changed significantly. Previously it required creating tons of different campaigns and ad
groups and doing very granular trageting.

Now, we put more faith in the Google AI algorithm.

Here's what we recommend as an overall hierarchy of Search account:

📌 1. One Search Campaign with Multiple Ad Groups (Consolidation >
Segmentation)

● Create 2-3 ad groups based on intent themes
● Use broad match for keyword discovery (Google's AI is now smart enough).
● Use smart bidding (Maximize Conversions → Target CPA when stable).
Example:

Let's use a Grass-Fed Lamb Chow premium dog food business in this example:

Campaign: Search – Core Keywords

● Ad Group 1: High-Intent Purchase Keywords
○ Keywords : Broad match terms like “buy [product]”, “[product] pricing”:
■ buy grass-fed lamb dog food
■ high protein dog food for active dogs
■ best raw lamb dog food
■ grain-free lamb dog food
○ Ad Copy : Strong CTA, price-based offers
■ Headline 1: "Grass-Fed Lamb Dog Food – Free Shipping!"
■ Headline 2: "High-Protein, Grain-Free – Vet Approved"
■ Description: "Try our all-natural, grass-fed lamb chow. Great for
sensitive stomachs. Order now & get 10% off!"
○ Landing Page: Product page or homepage (depending on product)
● Ad Group 2: Problem-Solution Keywords
○ Keywords : “[problem] solution”, “best [product] for [use case]”
■ best dog food for allergies
■ dog food for sensitive stomachs
■ healthy raw diet for dogs
■ best dog food for coat health
○ Ad Copy : Focus on pain points, problem-solving
■ Headline 1: "Sensitive Stomach? Try Grass-Fed Lamb!"
■ Headline 2: "Vet Recommended for Allergy-Prone Dogs"
■ Description: "Our lamb-based formula supports digestion & skin
health. See the difference in 30 days!"
○ Landing page: Talk directly to the problem and solution (allergies)
● Ad Group 3: Competitor Terms (Optional)
○ Keywords : Competitor brand names + qualifiers like “alternative”
■ Blue Buffalo lamb dog food alternative
■ Orijen lamb dog food vs
■ best Honest Kitchen dog food alternative
■ is Stella & Chewy’s good for dogs
○ Ad Copy : Positioning against competitors
■ Headline 1: "Better Than [Competitor]? Try This!"
■ Headline 2: "Grass-Fed Lamb – No Artificial Fillers"
■ Description: "More meat, no fillers, and healthier digestion.
Compare us to [Competitor] & see why dogs love it!"
○ Landing Page : Comparison page
Okay, perhaps some of these concepts (keywords, ad group, campaign) are new to you.

These are easiest to explain from lowest to highest in hierarchy.

Keywords
Keywords are added to Ad Groups.

In the example above, keywords look like "best dog food for allergies" and "high protein
dog food for active dogs"

When someone Googles anything, if their query (query: the words they type) is related
to the keywords you specified, Google will trigger the Ads (which have headlines and
descriptions) within the same ad group.

Google's AI is smart enough now that it includes all kinds of things that are similar to the
keyword:

● Gluten-free (instead of grain-free)
● Top dog food (instead of best dog food)
● best husky food (instead of dog food)
And it tries to filter out things that aren't directly related (cat food or snoop dogg food).

We'll talk more about keywords later. But this is a good first intro :)

Ads
Ads live inside ad groups and contain the ad copy that will entice someone to click
through to your website or app.

Ads should be very straightforward and get across what your product is. Quickly.

You only want the right people to click.

The ad copy should break the rules of most copy you'll ever write for marketing. You
want to actively discourage some people from clicking

Why is that?

Unlike on email or other ad channels where each click is free, on Google, you pay
whenever someone clicks on your ad.

So it’s essential that your ad copy discourages people from clicking if your product is not
relevant to them.

For example, if you sell a luxury product, you want to discourage someone looking for a
cheap version of the product. You could do this by using words like "luxury" or by
directly saying the price.

Repeat the terms used in the keywords in your ad.

Not only does this make the ad more relevant to the user, Google also boosts ads that
are closely related to the keywords. Impressions, clicks, and cost per click will all be
better.

Your paid ad won’t replace your organic search result. In fact, many of our clients have
both an ad and an organic result show at the same time. This is actually ideal, because
it gives the searcher twice as many opportunities to go to your site.

Some people never look below the ads, so you don’t reach them if you only show up in
the organic results.

Search ads give you a lot more control over what the user sees and where you send
them. You write the copy for the ad within the Google Ads UI and point the ad at
whatever web page you like. You don’t have to send them to your site’s homepage, you
can—and should—send them to tailored landing pages. We’ll dive into this later.

Assets/Extensions

You can also add “assets” (previously, "extension") to your ads to enhance them.

For example, the organic result above has “sitelink” assets that link to other pages on
the site. We’ll cover these as part of the module.

Ad groups
Ad Groups are contained within Campaigns. You create ads within ad groups, and
choose the keywords you’re going to target within ad groups.

Unlike in Facebook, where you configure most settings and targeting on the ad sets (an
ad set is basically the same as an ad group), you do very little targeting on ad groups
themselves. Instead, most settings are configured on campaigns, and ad groups are
mostly used to group related ads and keywords together.

Before AI got so smart, ad groups used to house only extremely similar keywords, now
instead we group them based on user intent.

For example with the dog food brand that could be:

High-Intent Buyers – People ready to purchase now.
○ Keywords: buy grass-fed dog food, best organic dog food, grain-free lamb
dog food
Health-Conscious Dog Owners – People researching the benefits of premium
dog food.
○ Keywords: best dog food for allergies, dog food for sensitive stomachs,
healthy dog diet
Competitor Alternatives – People searching for competitor brands and
alternatives.
○ Keywords: Blue Buffalo lamb dog food alternative, Orijen vs Honest
Kitchen dog food
First-Time Dog Owners – People new to buying premium dog food.
○ Keywords: best dog food for puppies, what is the healthiest dog food, best
puppy chow
Raw & Natural Diet Enthusiasts – People looking for minimally processed dog
food.
○ Keywords: raw diet for dogs, organic lamb dog food, high-protein dog food
Why do I group by intent and not just one big ad group?

There are a few reasons why you don't want just one massive ad group:

● Ad Relevance & Quality Score
○ Google still matches ad copy to search queries.
○ If you mix different intents (e.g., purchase vs. research queries), the
same ad will show for both.
○ This lowers click-through rate (CTR) and Quality Score , increasing cost
per click (CPC).
○ ✅ Grouping by intent ensures ad copy closely matches what
searchers are looking for.
● Better Landing Page Matching = Higher Conversions
○ Someone searching “buy grass-fed dog food” expects a product page.
○ Someone searching “best dog food for allergies” may need an
educational page first.
○ A single ad group would send everyone to the same page , hurting
conversions.
○ ✅ Intent-based ad groups send the right audience to the right
landing page.
● Better Budget Control & Performance Insights
○ If all queries are in one ad group , you can’t tell which intent type is
driving conversions.
○ You can’t adjust budgets by intent, meaning low-intent keywords could
waste spend.
○ ✅ Intent-based ad groups help optimize budget allocation based on
performance.
● More Efficient Bidding & Optimization
○ Google’s Smart Bidding optimizes based on past conversion data.
○ If all keywords are in one ad group , Google may waste budget testing
low-intent searches.
○ Separating purchase intent vs. research intent allows you to adjust
Target CPA/ROAS separately.
○ ✅ Prevents Google from over-prioritizing low-value searches.
● Better Negative Keyword Control
○ If all queries are in one ad group, negative keywords apply to
everything , which can block good searches.
○ With separate intent groups, you can apply negatives strategically (e.g.,
block “cheap” in purchase groups, but allow it in research groups ).
○ ✅ This reduces wasted spend while still capturing high-intent
searches.
So in summary:

● ❌ Too many ad groups = bad (data gets fragmented).
● ❌ One giant ad group = bad (low relevance, wasted budget).
● ✅ A few intent-based ad groups = best balance between automation and
advertiser control.
Campaign
A campaign is an overarching group that contains ad groups. Unlike ad groups, there
are a ton of different ways that you can configure campaigns.

With campaigns, you're able to configure the following:

● Objective – Defines what Google optimizes for. Options include Sales, Leads,
Website Traffic, Brand Awareness, App Promotion, or Local Store Visits.
● Bidding Strategy – Controls how Google bids in auctions. Common options:
○ Maximize Conversions (default for new campaigns)
○ Target CPA (tCPA) (once conversion data is available)
○ Target ROAS (tROAS) (for revenue-based optimization)
● Budget – The total spend Google can allocate daily.
● Networks – Determines where ads appear:
○ Search Network (Google Search, Shopping tab, partner sites)
○ Display Network (YouTube, Gmail, other websites)
● Locations – Defines geographical targeting. Can be countries, states, cities, or
radius around locations.
● Languages – Filters users based on their browser language settings.
● Ad Schedule – Sets specific days/hours when ads can run.
● Conversion Tracking – Defines what actions count as conversions (purchases,
sign-ups, calls, etc.).
● Audience Targeting (Optional) – Signals Google’s AI to prioritize specific user
groups (e.g., past website visitors, in-market shoppers).
● Negative Keywords (Optional) – Blocks irrelevant searches at the campaign
level.
Okay wow that's a lot of things. Let's talk about why you would decide to create different
campaigns.

You create different campaigns for a few reasons:

Different Budgets for Different Goals
○ Example: You want to spend more on high-intent purchase searches
and less on research-based searches.
○ Separate campaigns allow you to control budget allocation more
effectively.
Different Bidding Strategies
○ Example: You want to use Target ROAS for purchase-intent searches
but Maximize Conversions for competitor terms.
○ Google’s Smart Bidding works best when campaigns are optimized for
one clear goal.
Geographic Targeting
○ Example: You sell in multiple countries and need different messaging,
pricing, or regulations for each.
Branded vs. Non-Branded Keywords
○ Branded campaign : Targets searches with your brand name (e.g., “XYZ
Dog Food” ).
○ Non-branded campaign : Targets generic high-intent terms (e.g., “best
organic dog food” ).
○ Keeps brand traffic separate from prospecting for better budget
control.
Search vs. Competitor Terms
○ If bidding on competitor keywords , separating them prevents Google
from prioritizing them over your own high-intent terms.
What should I do as a new account?

For a startup or newer advertiser with a smaller budget (<$3K/month) , one Search
campaign is usually enough to keep things simple.

● Start with: One well-structured campaign with intent-based ad groups.
● Expand later if budget and performance justify segmenting into multiple
campaigns.
PHEW. That was a lot of info.

But now you honestly know 90% of the foundational knowledge. Let's start getting to
work building your campaign.

Project: Search Ads
The Growth Program is about doing, not just learning.

So, instead of trying to teach you every little thing about Search Ads before we start
doing anything, we're going to do this in stages.

So, let's get started with the basic structure of your account.

What you’ll do
● Set up your account
● Create your first campaigns and ad groups
● Add your initial keywords
Prerequisites
● Google Ads conversion tracking should have been set up
● A product and website to create campaigns for
Introduction
In this project, we’ll set up your first campaign(s), ad groups, and keywords. They will be
rough, unoptimized, and potentially entirely wrong.

But that’s okay!

In future lessons, you’ll learn how to choose the right keywords, write ad copy, add ad
assets, change landing pages, improve targeting, change campaign structure, and
optimize. I

We won’t even create ads for now since we haven’t talked about ad copy yet.

This project aims to get you comfortable with the interface and apply your first lesson.
Again, we didn't want you to read for 10 hours before doing anything!

After additional lessons to improve the individual pieces, we'll return to these campaigns
later.

We’ll use the Growth Program as an example, but apply the steps to your own
business.

Phase 1: Setup
Make a copy of the Google Doc template.

Then, skim this completed doc to see what we’re working towards.

Phase 2a: Campaigns
Since we're just getting started and we're realistically going to have a modest testing
budget, we'll keep this relatively simple with these parameters:

● Optimize for those most likely to purchase
● No branded campaigns (i.e. terms without your brand name)
● Keep it simple, only one campaign
So we'll just do one campaign called:

Campaign: Search – High-Intent Leads

● Objective: Capture users actively looking for the product/service
● Bidding: Maximize Conversions (switch to Target CPA after 30+ conversions)
● Budget: ~$50-100 per day
● Location : United States, Canada, United Kingdom (or wherever you ship/sell)
Phase 2b: Decide on ad groups
After you make your campaigns (it will happen, we promise), we’ll need to add some ad
groups to your campaign. As a reminder, ad groups are grouped together based on user
intent. For example:

● Direct purchase intent
● Problem-solution searches
○ Note: if you solve numerous problems, you could break this into several
related ad groups
● Competitor alternatives
Replace the ad groups in your doc with the relevant ad groups.

You will decide the keywords in the next step.

Phase 3: Decide on keywords
Google recommends 5-12 related keywords per ad group, but in the name of simplicity,
you can do ~3 keywords per ad group for now.

Use any words you think people would Google in that category. We’ll have a more
systematic way of developing these in a bit.

Or, frankly, just give ChatGPT your product page and ask it to give you keywords
for your ad groups.

For example, for the Growth Program, we might do something like this:

Ad Group 1: Direct Purchase Intent

● Keywords:
○ growth marketing course
○ best growth marketing training
○ learn growth marketing online
● Landing Page: Direct to product/service page
Ad Group 2: Problem-Solution Searches

● Keywords:
○ how to scale a startup
○ best customer acquisition strategies
○ how to get more users
● Landing Page: Content-driven page explaining benefits, with CTA
Ad Group 3: Competitor Alternatives

● Keywords:
○ CXL alternatives
○ alternative to Reforge growth course
● Landing Page: Competitor comparison page
Add these to your doc.

Phase 4: Add your first campaign to Google Ads
Now that you’ve specced out your initial campaigns, ad groups, and keywords, it’s time
to add them to Google Ads.

Here’s how to do the first one.

Note: If the screen you end up at doesn't seem to follow these steps, look for a link that
says something like "I'm an expert. Skip this." and click it.

4a. Start a new campaign

First, go to your Google Ads dashboard

You can either:

● Click the big blue + New Campaign button then click + New Campaign again or
● Click Create in the top left and then Campaign
Then let's just do Create a campaign without a goal's guidance. Google will make
recommendations for you depending on the other choices, but we’re here for that 🙂

Choose Search

Next, you'll see three conversion goal options to choose from. Leave these blank for
now. We'll circle back and define campaign goals in a later step.

Then choose Website visits and enter your site:

Campaign name: Give your campaign a name. For now, do Search – High-Intent
Leads

Click Continue. Next we move onto all the various campaign settings that looks like
this:

4b. Configure campaign settings

Bidding

● Bid strategy: Select 'Conversions' from the ' What do you want to focus on?'
dropdown. It will likely be the default.
○ The algorithm has gotten so good that it's generally advisable to let
Google decide how much you're willing to pay per click (because it will
automatically charge a lot for a hot lead, and not much for a cold lead).
● Target CPA: This is optional, but it lets you set how much you're willing to pay
per conversions on each keyword.
○ Remember there's a trade off between CPA and volume. If sell a thing for
$100 that costs you $40 to service, you can afford max $60 per
conversion. If you set it to $30, you'll get fewer conversions but each
conversion will be more profitable. If you set it to $60, you'll get more
conversions but you'll be breaking even. Balance this accordingly.
○ Usually at the initial stages you'll want to see if Search Ads can work AT
ALL. So I'd recommend putting a higher than ideal Target CPA.
● Customer Acquisition: Here you can get Google to treat existing customers
differently—which is a good idea since you are looking to GROW your customer
base, not just squeeze more from your existing one (which you can also do with
email marketing).
○ If you have a list of > 1,000 existing customers then you can check the box
for " Optimize campaign for acquiring new customers " and upload that list.
It can either be static (a CSV upload) or dynamic (defined from past
conversions).
○ If you don't have that list, just leave this blank for now
Networks

● Search : Keep Google Search Partners Network enabled
● Display : We recommend disabling Google Display Network for now so you can
focus on just testing Search out for now. You can test Display later.
Locations

● Add your main target market, such as the United States and Canada
● We'll dive deeper into Location targeting later but for now expand Location
options and select Presence. This ensures it only targets people who LIVE in
those places.
Languages

● Use your main target language, such as English
Audience Segment

Just leave this the way it is for now!

Broad match keywords

Keep this on.

As we've said, Google's algorithms are really good and are increasingly getting better.
We definitely recommend keeping this enabled so you leave it more up to the algorithm.
Doing it manually by turning this off will more than likely end up backfiring.

Automatically created assets

This is default off. If you want to test it, you can try turning it on as it may give you great
results—or at least be a good starting point.

Otherwise, I'll walk you through creating stuff yourself.

Click Next

4c. Configure keyword and asset generation
You can get Google to scan your site and generate an ad group, keywords, and ads
based on what it finds.

This is a great starting point for the first ad group.

Check to make sure the URL and description are accurate, then click Generate

4d. Configure ad groups, keywords, and ads
Google will then create a bunch products/services and some keywords associated to
them:

If it got anything wrong, or is missing anything major, change them now.

Otherwise, this might be a great starting point.

A reminder of the ad groups we plan to create:

● Ad Group 1: Direct Purchase Intent
● Ad Group 2: Problem-Solution Searches
● Ad Group 3: Competitor alternatives
What Google generated is likely Ad Group 1. So here's what I recommend for now
(remember this is just a first quick pass):

Rename " Ad Group 1 " to " Direct Purchase Intent "
Edit the keywords to add anything you feel is missing
Accept the ad copy it generated
Click Next.
We'll create the other ad groups and adjust the ads and keywords later.

4e. Budget
Here you'll set how much you're willing to spend per day on this campaign.

Set your daily budget to $1 per day so we don't accidentally run a suboptimal
campaign and waste your money.

Note: this is a placeholder; you can and will change this later).

4f. Review and publish the campaign (we'll pause
after)
Don't worry, we're just "publishing it" so it gets created. The next step will be to
pause the campaign.

But take this opportunity to check over everything:

And then click Publish campaign.

Then you'll want to go Campaigns -> Campaigns -> Click the green dot, and then
select Pause.

Pause the campaign so you don’t spend any money. Unless you really want to test
running any ads that you may have created. (Don’t. Yet. Not worth it.)

To pause campaigns, in the campaign, click the Enabled dropdown in the top left, and
select Pause.

It should look like this after it's Paused:

4g. Manually create the other ad groups
Okay now that you have one ad group made, lets make the others. Here's again the list
of ad groups:

● Ad Group 1: Direct Purchase Intent
● Ad Group 2: Problem-Solution Searches
● Ad Group 3: Competitor alternatives
Navigate to Campaigns -> Ad Groups -> the big blue plus button to create a new ad
group

Create an ad group

Name the ad group
Paste in some starting keywords, for example:
Click Save and continue
Select whatever default ad copy they generate (this is all placeholder)
Click Save and continue
Repeat for other ad groups
Congrats, you have a placeholder campaign with ad
groups, keywords, and ads
I know this was a lot, and I'm trying to reduce the overwhelm by breaking this up into
stages.

For now we have a paused campaign with the skeleton in place, and from here on out
we'll be adding better keywords, ad copy, and ad assets from here.

See you in the next lesson!

Keywords
What you’ll learn
● The old way
● The modern way
● Keyword best practices
● What negative keywords are and why they’re important
● How to handle “generic keywords”
Introduction
Keywords are essentially the targeting options for Search Ads.

In this lesson we'll dive deep into the specifics of keywords—including how they used to
work and how they work now.

I do that not as a history lesson, but in case you'd heard how it used to work and
confused why we're not talking about it.

We’ll follow this lesson with a project to update your keywords based on what you learn.

The old way: match types
Back in the day (pre AI boom), you had 4 different types of keywords you could choose
depending on how strict you wanted to be on matching the keyword to actual search
terms.

For example, match types controlled whether a keyword for "women's hats" would get
triggered by a search for " women's hats" as well as a search for " hats for women" or
" where can women buy hats ?"

The match types were:

● Broad match : ads showed on searches that related to the keyword. So a
keyword for womens hats could have triggered for womens fashion.
● Broad match modifier : ads showed on specific usage of words (except for
minor variations like woman vs women) but the word order did not matter.
● Phrase match: Ads would show only if the words in the search term were used
in the exact order that they were listed in the keyword
○ A keyword of "womens hats" would not show for "hats for women"
● Exact match : Ads would show only if the search term exactly matched the
keyword
○ A keyword of [womens hats] would only show if they searched "womens
hats"
The old optimal way to run Search Ads was to get really granular with a lot of exact
match terms in one campaign since they were most likely to perform best.

And then you'd have another campaign that used broader keywords in the hopes of
discovering other search terms that were leading to conversions. You'd then turn those
searcht erms into more exact match keywords for the other campaign.

This was called keyword mining.

But this isn't really how it's done anymore.

The new way: broad match is king
As we've mentioned, the Google algorithm increasingly knows far better than we do.

At this point if you manually did keywords the old way, you'd almost guaranteed do
worse than what Google's AI.

Why? Because it's working with trillions of data points across billions of people.

And AI is getting smarter and smarter.

So today, keywords are essentially just broad match.

And when we enter BM keywords, we just put the words themselves:

● women's hats
● clothing for women
The words in the keyword can be used in any order, and not every word even needs to
be included (unless the keyword is one word — a “single word keyword”).

For example, women's hats would trigger ads in all these instances:

● women's hats
● online woman hat
● women's chapeaus
● hats for women
● benefits of a woman wearing a hat
● the best hat for a woman
● women's berets
● womens fedoras
● womens sun hats
And Google probably knows you're a woman or not, so it could also trigger for:

● best hats
● summer hats
● sun hats
● where can I find a hat?
Luckily, this makes your job of campaign management a lot less complicated. But
it does make it more confusing since it's more of a black box.

Let's dive into another common keyword concept:

Long-tail keywords
A long-tail keyword is one with a bunch of words in it, and, as a result, is a lot more
specific.

For example, a broad, fat-head keyword is shirts. Some long-tail keywords containing
shirts are:

● best longsleeve shirts for men
● warm merino wool shirts men
● where can I buy shirts
● how can I repair a shirt
Because they’re so specific, long-tail keywords receive far less search volume than
broad ones. Shirts likely receives millions of hits per month, whereas those other terms
may only receive a few hundred or thousand.

This is in part because a lot of people search the single word shirts. But the keyword
shirts can also trigger a million variations of long-tail keywords containing shirts —
including all the ones we put above.

We call them long-tail because if you graph out how often people search for them, they
show up in the “tail” of the graph — where there are a lot fewer searches:

Benefits of long-tail keywords
Long-tail keywords have a lot less competition, and they’re super specific, which:

● Lets you target “warmer leads.”
○ For example, someone searching for best longsleeve shirts for men is a
lot more likely to purchase a men’s longsleeve shirt from you than
someone looking for shirts.
● More specifically tells Google what you sell.
○ Instead of just saying "shirts" it now knows you sell "warm merino wool
shirts for men." Meaning it has more information to use to find the right
person and the right search query.
What's crazy is that the algorithm is getting very smart and has a ton of data to
work with. So even if someone just googles "winter shirts," they might know that
this is the type of person who would buy a men's merino wool shirt.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, you (and Google) have no idea why someone
typed in just the word shirts:

● Maybe they wanted an image of a shirt.
● Maybe they mistyped shorts.
● Maybe they're learning English. It could be any number of reasons.
Long-tail keywords are useful.

Recommendation
Target a combination of short-tail and long-tail keywords with your ads.

Short-tail terms will help capture a lot of long-tail terms that you never thought of.
Sometimes, the person searching for shirts actually wants to buy a shirt.

Once you’ve identified longer-tail keywords that do well, add them in as keywords to
make your ads more efficient. Having the long-tail keyword will always perform better
(meaning: it will be cheaper for you) than having the short-tail version.

Negative keywords
A negative keyword tells google when NOT to trigger an ad.

You'd want to use negative keywords in a few situations:

● You want to weed out people unlikely to purchase at all
○ For example, if you sell luxury shoes, you'll likely want to exclude words
like "cheap" or "free" or "affordable" so you don't waste money selling your
expensive shoes to people who are unlikely to buy them.
● You want to be conservative and weed out people who aren't looking to buy right
now. In that case you might exclude
○ “how to”
○ “what is”
○ tutorials
○ courses
○ lessons
○ examples
● You sell a specific thing but the keywords people would use to find it may
accidentally be used to find something else as well
○ For example, if you sell coffee, an ad targeting the keyword "best coffee,"
will lead to things like:
■ best coffee machine
■ best coffee grinder
■ best coffee tamper
■ best coffee cups
○ Assuming you only sell coffee, then it would likely be unprofitable to show
ads for these queries.
○ If we wanted to keep targeting the broad term "best coffee" for your online
coffee delivery business, we would add negative keywords like machine
and grinder, and any tool related to making coffee.
● You have a generic brand name and don't want
Negative keywords are increasingly becoming important because:

● Broad match keywords (which is all we've got) give you very little control as
compared to the old system. Negative keywords are the only way to exclude
things, and one of the few ways to guide Google in the right direction.
● It's increasingly harder to see what people actually searched before clicking your
ads.
○ Previously you could see exactly what people had typed in before they
clicked your ads. A big part of optimizing campaigns was going through
the search terms and either excluding things that were wrong, or adding
keywords for things that performed well.
○ However, due to privacy issues, they hide almost all of the search terms.
Essentially, they found that an advertisers could figure out exactly what
individual customers had typed in before they bought, which was bound to
cause trouble.
Add negative keywords before running ads

Spending money on irrelevant keywords is an incredibly easy way to lose money.

It is 100% worth your time to thoroughly create lists of negative keywords
BEFORE you run them. You can do that by:

● Do a first pass creating them yourself
○ Look at your product and look at the ad groups and keywords you
have specced out. Think of unrelated things that people may search
that include those keywords. For example, if you sell women’s
clothing, you probably want to remove terms for men, girl, boy,
children, infant, baby, and more.
● Throw your keywords into Google and see what comes up (both in the
search results but also as suggested searches)
○ For example, for a UI design software program, you may be tempted to
add a keyword for design program. Searching "UI design program" (in
Vancouver) comes up with things like this:
○ This tells us that we should add negative keywords for things like:
■ university
■ school
■ course
■ film
■ game
■ graphic
■ full-time
■ part-time
■ certificate
■ degree
■ and more
● Use AI to generate a list

○ Give your favorite AI tool (or several of them) your website, tell them
you're running your first Search Ads, and ask them to generate a list of
negative keywords
○ For example, here I got ChatGPT 4o to do it here:
https://chatgpt.com/share/67be2663-0afc-800a-80ca-2adaa5192e4c.

Here's a preview:

○ Don't just blindly copy paste from AI. It will likely mess things up. For
example, it suggests the word agency and we ARE an agency, so we
definitely would not want to include that one.
Add to negative keywords as you go

You can try to guess all the negative keywords you need at the beginning, but you're not
going to get them all.

It’s impossible to foresee all the things that millions of people with different goals will
come up with.

So you’ll mostly have to add negative keywords after you run some ads. This is normal.

Pop into Insights & reports > Search Terms within Google Ads to see the searches
people are making when they see your ads.

Add negative keywords for things in that list.

But as I said, this doesn't show nearly as many as it used to (for privacy reasons) so it's
good not to rely on this.

Be careful

You want to be quick to add negative keywords to avoid wasting money, but think
deeply whether adding the negative keyword will also potentially block legitimate
customers from seeing your ads.

For example, you may actually want to not add free to your negative keywords. For
example, if you sell a gluten-free version of something, like a protein bar, you would
want people searching for gluten free protein bar to see your ads. Exclude free for
software, not ecommerce; people know they have to pay for physical goods.

Negative keyword lists
As mentioned, negative keywords can be added at the campaign or ad group level. But
what if you have multiple campaigns that would have the same negative keywords?

For those situations, you can create a Negative keyword list and add it to multiple
campaigns and ad groups at the same time—saving you a lot of duplication.

You can do that here:

Recommendation
Even if you only have one campaign for now, create at least one negative keyword list
called All Campaigns and apply it to all campaigns. This will contain all negative
keywords that are broadly applicable across your account.

Then, make new negative keyword lists if you find yourself duplicating keywords across
a few (but not all) campaigns or ad groups. Always reduce duplication whenever
possible.

(We’ll teach you how to do this step-by-step in the upcoming project.)

Keywords to avoid
Generic keywords
Generic keywords have words that can be used in a variety of different contexts.
They’re your biggest enemies.

Especially when it comes to brand names for yourself and your competitors.

For example, some of our past clients include Service, Envoy, and Streak. Those are
words used in everyday speech. As a result, advertising on branded keywords for them
was very expensive, since a lot of search terms including their name were for
completely unrelated things.

If you notice that one of your ideas for an ad group is fairly generic, you’ll have to do
one of two things:

Use the short-tail keywords and add a lot of negative keywords.
You’ll still end up spending a lot of money in vain as you hit people with
unrelated searches, but you’ll also capture everyone in your market.
Use only long-tail keywords. For example, Envoy could target envoy visitor signin
and envoy visitor checkin. Or even just envoy visitor.
1. This is more efficient, but most people searching for a brand name would
just search envoy. Did you type in facebook social network when you went
to sign up for Facebook? Probably not.
Neither option is ideal, but #2 is more budget-friendly. Go that route if you’re a scrappy
startup — it just means you won’t be as thorough.

Okay, let's move on!

Project: Keywords
Now that you’ve learned more about keywords, it’s time to put your knowledge to use in
your account. Let’s walk through all this now.

What you’ll do
● Create a negative keyword list
● Add negative keywords to your account
● Do keyword research and add additional keywords (and ad groups as necessary)
Phase 1: Brainstorm new keywords
So before we very lazily used some auto generated keywords, or sloppily shot some off
the top of our brain. Here we'll brainstorm some actual keywords to your campaigns.

There are far more systematic ways to brainstorm keywords.

Here's a few ways:

Use the Keyword Planner in Google Ads
Use ChatGPT (or other AI) to give you ideas
Use tools like SEMrush and Ahrefs. For this, you can do the Keyword Research
project (except phase 4) from our Content Marketing module to learn more about
the process.
Here's a video of how to use Keyword Planner and AI:

Phase 2: Add new keywords
Once you have some ideas, it's time to add them to ad groups.

Shoot for 5-10 keywords per ad group.

If you have more than 10 keywords for an ad group, see if you can break those down
into different categories to make several ad groups. For example, you can make
different versions of the Problem-Solution Searches ad group (multiple specific
problems) or the High-Intent Purchasers ad group (particularly if you have numerous
products or customer types).

For example, I could break Problem-Soltution searches into 3 distinct problems:

● Not Enough Customers / Traffic
○ How to get more customers
○ How to get more website traffic
○ How to drive traffic to my website
○ Customer acquisition strategies
○ How to acquire users for a startup
● Struggling With Paid Ads ROI
○ CAC too high
○ Facebook ads strategy
○ improve ad conversions
○ scale google ads
○ facebook ads not working
● Scaling & Retention Challenges
○ Increase LTV
○ improve retention
○ why users churning
○ reduce user churn
○ how to grow profitaby
Note: The above are just examples and not necessarily the ideal keywords for this.

Add the keywords you generated in Phase 1 to your ad groups (or make new ad
groups).

Phase 3: Create a negative keyword list
Now that we have some keywords in your ad groups, it's time to make sure you don't
waste money targeting irrelevant searches.

As we said in the last lesson, negative keywords are incredibly important now that
Google is all about the broad match keywords and AI.

To avoid future work of needing duplicating negative keywords across future additional
campaign, let’s set up a negative keyword lists to use for all campaigns.

You can do it in the Keywords > Negative Keywords tab as you add them to a specific
campaign, but let’s do it through the official route:

Click Tools > Shared Library > Exclusion lists
Click the massive blue +
Name it All Campaigns
Add a list of keywords that are broadly inappropriate for your business
Reference our section on negative keywords here.
Use ChatGPT to generate a bunch of ideas (make sure to verify before
using). For example:
Use Google search to generate ideas by typing in some keywords (both
from search results and suggested results)
As a simple example, we are a paid growth marketing course for adults
done remotely. We want to filter out people looking for free/cheap things,
courses for children, and courses at colleges. We also want to filter out
people who don’t know what marketing is. They are way too low on the
product awareness level to lead to a sale anytime soon.
Click Save
Select the list by ticking the box at the left of it, and then click Apply to
campaigns
Select every campaign in the list and click Apply
Now all these keywords, and any future keywords you add to this list, will be excluded
from every campaign.

We'll likely expand this list later as we add more keywords to our campaigns and
discover more things that should be excluded.

Phase 4: Add negative words to your
campaigns/ad groups
Next, you should add negative keywords to specific campaigns and ad groups.

These are negative keywords that are not broadly applicable to every campaign or ad
group, but are specific to those campaigns/ad groups.

For example, our brand name, Demand Curve, has multiple meanings — it’s a common
concept in economics.

If we ran a Brand campaign (not the ad groups, because the “generic” problem exists in
all the ad groups in the campaign), we should try to mitigate this by adding negative
keywords.

Here's how to find keywords to add to negative keywords for specific ad groups:

● Go to Google and enter your keywords
● Take note of anything that comes up in suggested searches or search results
● Put the keywords in Keyword Planner and see what else comes up
● Dump your keywords into ChatGPT and ask for negative keywords specifically
for them (give it your website as well)
Here's how to add them

Go to the specific campaign or ad group
Go to the Audience, keywords, and content dropdown in the left-hand column
Click Search Keywords underneath it
Then click in the top middle Negative search keywords
Click the big blue +
Add keywords as necessary
Remember that you can also type your keywords into Google to see what comes
up if you need ideas, or use other methods of keyword research.
When you’ve added everything, click Save
Repeat this for all other campaigns and ad groups
Yeehaw, time to learn more about bids!
What you’ll learn
● What Quality Score is and why it’s important
● The concept of bidding in Google Ads
● The different bidding strategies Google has
● Which bid strategies to use and when to use them
Introduction
When and where your ad get shown, and how much you pay for a click is more
complicated than you'd think.

Google determines that using three factors:

● Your ad/keywords Quality Score (we dive into what this is below) and
● Your bid on the keyword that triggered the ad.
● How those compare to everyone else bidding on that same keyword
Say, for example, you’re targeting the keyword women's hats, and Google decides you
can spend a max of $2 for that click (because you're on Maximize Conversions with a
Target CPA of $40).

Google will calculate your and all your competitor’s Quality Scores for that term and use
them along with your bids to determine whether and where to display your ads and how
much you’ll each pay for a click.

What's even more confusing?

The confusing part is that just because Google set your bid to $2 doesn’t mean you’ll
pay $2 for the click. You could only pay $0.76.

Why? Because your next highest competitor could have a lower bid, and their Quality
Score could be lower. So Google would only make you pay as much as you absolutely
needed to in order to win (and not a cent more).

That’s why Quality Score is so important.

Quality Score
Quality Score (QS) is Google's internal rating of the quality and relevance of your
keywords, ads, and landing pages, as well as their similarity to each other.

Put neatly: it’s how well your ad and your website answer the search term.

Having a high Quality Score means you get rewarded with:

● Higher ad positions : Your ads get shown on the first page and near the top
more often
● More impressions and clicks : Your ads get shown more often relative to
competitors
● Lower costs: You pay less per click even if someone else with a lower Quality
Score was willing to pay more for it
Your Quality Score depends on multiple factors, including:

● Expected Click-Through Rate (CTR) for that keyword, based on historical
performance and competitor benchmarks
○ Google aims to show the most relevant result for a search query as
efficiently as possible.
○ If more people click on your ad compared to others in the same auction,
Google interprets this as a sign that your ad better matches user intent.
● The relevance of each keyword to its ad group
○ Are the keywords in an ad group closely related to each other, like buy
organic supplements and buy natural supplements?
○ Or are they too different, like women’s hats and Bayesian optimization?
○ Google evaluates semantic relevance , meaning the keywords should
share a common theme and intent rather than just exact matches.
● Landing page experience and relevance to the search query
○ Does the page clearly answer the searcher's query?
○ Is the page fast-loading and mobile-friendly?
○ Is the site secure (HTTPS)?
○ Does it provide a good user experience , free from intrusive pop-ups or
misleading content?
○ Is the content relevant to the ad and keyword?
● Ad relevance to the search query
○ The more relevant your ad text is to the search query, the better.
○ Google understands search intent beyond just exact keyword matching,
but including keywords in the ad can improve performance.
● Ad assets (formerly called ad extensions)
○ Using sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets, and other assets
improves ad engagement, leading to better CTR and a higher Quality
Score.
○ More on this later
● Historical Google Ads account performance
○ Does your account have a history of high CTRs, strong ad relevance,
and good landing page experiences?
○ A strong track record with Google Ads policies and consistent ad
performance over time can positively impact your Quality Score.
How is Quality Score recorded?

You are ranked on three metrics:

● Landing Page Experience
● Ad Relevance
● Click Through Rate
Each with either be Below Average, Average, or Above Average to give you a score of

Here's how it's weighted (thanks to Adalysis for this chart)

Therefore, increasing CTR (by making the ad more enticing and relevant to the user’s
search query) and improving your landing page has the largest impact on Quality Score.

Checking your Quality Score
Your Quality Score is shown at a keyword level and is shown in the custom columns. To
turn it on, click on the columns icon in the top right, then select Modify columns. Then,
under Quality Score, toggle the following columns on (you can hover over them to learn
more):

Quality Score
Landing page exp.
Exp. CTR
Ad relevance
Click Apply.
Now when you check your keywords, you should see information such as this:

This gives us a ton of information:

● Our Quality Score for the first keyword is 7/10
○ This is perfect and means that there's some definite room for
improvement.
● Our expected clickthrough rate is lower than competitors
○ This means our ad copy, our historical performance, or our brand, must be
lacking
● Our ad relevance is above that of competitors, this may mean:
○ Our ad copy relates very closely to this keyword
○ The keywords in our ad group are tightly grouped in the same semantic
meaning
● Our landing page experience is better than competitors, potentially because it:
○ Relates to the search query and ad copy
○ Explains our product before asking visitors to fill out forms (don’t put a
form at the very top of the landing page)
○ Is optimized for both desktop and mobile users
○ Loads quickly
○ Has good performance metrics for bounce rate, time on site, conversions,
and people completing their search on our site
You’ll want to check the Quality Score of all your keywords on a periodic basis and
strive to improve all those with low scores. The goal is to get them all as high as
possible.

Because the higher it is, the more often you'll be shown and the cheaper it'll cost
per click.

You’ll never hit 10/10 for all the keywords.

Your competitors have valid products too, and they probably market themselves towards
specific keywords that are different than your own. You can’t win ‘em all. But you can
steal a lot of traffic from them.

The specific changes you need to make depend on what you’re ranking “Below
average” on, and even still, you’re left guessing a little bit because they’re a mix of
factors that aren’t explained. The key is to make fixes and check in later to see if your
ads have improved.

Bids
A "bid" in Google is the maximum amount you’re willing to pay for a click for a particular
keyword.

Luckily, we don't recommend manually setting bids for keywords anymore. You
should let Google figure out how much you're willing to pay per click based on
your goal.

You set your goal using bid strategies. These strategies are set on the campaign, and
it dictates how Google will bid on keywords.

One of the strategies is completely manual (you set the maximum bids yourself), and
the rest are varying degrees of automatic bidding (Google sets and/or changes the bids
for you), each with different goals.

We of course recommend automatic bidding, but let's dive into what they all mean.

Bid strategies
There are a handful of different bid strategies with different goals and use cases. It can
be a bit confusing at first, especially since Google kinda breaks them into two different
views, so let’s go over each one and why you might want to use it.

We’ll cover each type, and then go through our step-by-step process for how we pick a
bid strategy.

Here is the default view for Google Ads and it's all about optimizing towards a goal, and
this is what we recommend focusing on to let Google do its thing:

Here's a quick overview of what that means:

● Conversions : You optimize for the most amount of conversions (sign ups, sales,
etc) for your budget.
○ This is generally what we recommend in most cases, particularly if you're
optimizing towards a non-paid event (sign up, download, etc)
○ For this you can set a Target CPA meaning if you want to acquire
customers for $50 each or less, you can give Google that information
● Conversion value: You optimize for more conversion VALUE (basically, more
dollars) instead of optimizing for as many conversions as possible.
○ If you're an ecomm store where each purchase can range wildly in price,
this is probably a great idea since it'll optimize for generating more
revenue rather than raw sales.
○ For this you can set a Target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) , so for
exampleif you are profitable at a 50% margin, you can set a target ROAS
of greater than 200%.
● Clicks: You optimize for as many clicks as possible.
○ We do not recommend this as it's a great way to spend money on low
quality clicks.
○ You can set a maximum cost per click.
○ Again we don't recommend this.
● Impression share: You optimize for being VISIBLE for as many searches as
possible.
○ This is a rare case and might be useful for branded search terms (ones
with your brand name in it) so that competitors don't steal your traffic
away.
○ You can set a target impression share (so if you want to be seen at 90% of
the time you can set that).
○ We generally don't advise these unless you're really big.
A note on conversions
When we talk about bidding strategies and goals, we end up talking about conversions.

We should take a moment to talk about them in more detail.

As a reminder, a conversion is a user doing a desired action after clicking on your ad.
That can be a newsletter sign up, free trial, app install, purchase, add to cart, or some
other nuanced event.

How do I pick a primary conversion?

In Google there are two types of conversions, Primary and Secondary.

Primary is what a campaign is optimized towards. Secondary are just for informational
purposes.

For example you could have a purchase be Primary and Secondary could be View
Product Page, Add to Cart, and Initiate Checkout. With that you could see if your leads
are falling off at a specific part of the funnel.

Should I always have a purchase event as primary?

Your primary conversion should almost always be a paid event (like purchase or
upgrade) except in these two situations:

You don’t have a paid event because you’re a free product.
In that case, take the most important metric, like sign up.
Paid events occur rarely or after a very long delay.
If you only have a few sales per month or quarter, or if you have a long
sales cycle of weeks to months (possibly due to a free trial), then you’re
better off choosing an intermediary metric that occurs more often. This
could be a sign up or a sales lead.
Your product is expensive but you budget is low
If you make thousands per customer and you can technically afford
thousands per customer, but you don't want to invest many many
thousands or tens of thousands of dollars to see if this is going to work,
then you should maybe test an event that is earlier in the funnel (like
submitting the lead form).
Each campaign can have different conversion goals

You can also have different conversion goals for different campaigns.

If for example you wanted to use one Campaign to push for sales and another for
newsletter sign ups, you can do that, but you'd need to put them in different campaigns.

Then in the campaign you can adjust it in the campaign settings here:

OK. On to our bid strategies.

Maximize conversions
● Google will bid whatever it feels necessary to maximize the number of
conversions within the campaign’s budget. This can occasionally lead to
extremely high CPC’s (but that's because they think it's super hot lead).
● When to use: This is the default!
With a Target CPA

● Instead of giving Google free reign you set a “target CPA” (a.k.a. target cost per
action) across the campaign.
● Google will bid to get as many conversions as it can at or below your target CPA.
It won’t always get there, but it will try.
● Google will need at least 10-20 conversions in the campaign before it can do this
properly
● You can set max and min bids, but this isn’t recommend. Let Google do its thing.
● When to use: Use this as soon as you can since it's better than leaving Google
blind!
Maximize clicks
● Google will bid and spend whatever it feels necessary to maximize the number of
clicks on your ads without worrying about conversions
● When to use: Pure brand exposure and eyeballs to your site
With max CPC

● If you want as many clicks as possible but don't want to spend more than a
certain amount, you can set that here.
Maximize conversion value
● Google will bid whatever it feels necessary to maximize the amount of money
you get back from the ads. This can occasionally lead to extremely high CPC’s
(but that's because they think it's super hot lead).
● When to use: If your purchases range in value significantly.
With a Target ROAS

● Similar to Target CPA. Instead, you set your target return on ad spend as a
percentage. For example, if you want your revenue to be four times higher (e.x
$100) than the cost of running an ad (e.x. $25), then you would set it to 400%.
● This uses the conversion value instead of the cost per conversion, which makes
it ideal if the money you make changes per purchase (due to different cart sizes
or prices).
● Google will need > 15 conversions in a 30 day period on the campaign to
calculate ROAS. Having at least 50 conversions is better.
● When to use: Once you have some decent conversion volume. This is the ideal
bidding strategy if you want to maximize conversions and want to ensure they’re
profitable.
Impression share
● This is to maximize how often your ads show when someone searches related
keywords.
● This is a rare case and might be useful for branded search terms (ones with your
brand name in it) so that competitors don't steal your traffic away.
● You can set a target impression share (so if you want to be seen at 90% of the
time you can set that).
● When to use: If you want to beat out one or more of your competitors and don’t
care about conversions or profitability in the process—such as brand or
competitor campaigns
This is rare so I won't go deeper.

Our strategy
Now that you know the different strategies, let’s dive into what we recommend.

Step 1: Start with Maximize conversions (with Target
CPA)
Start campaigns with Maximize Conversions.

Let Google's AI do the work and figure things out.

This means google will automatically handle bids.

To start, set the Target CPA at your breakeven point so it gives Google a bit more wiggle
room to learn.

Step 2: Optimize performance
We’ll go through this a few lessons from now.

Step 3: Switch to Maximize Conversion Value with
Target ROAS
If you are using a paid conversion event then the next step is Target
ROAS—which requires at least 15 conversions in the last 30 days

Why? Because it will try to get bigger spenders and will be willing to spend more money
to acquire them.

If you are not using a paid conversion event, stick to Target CPA.

Now to adjust the copy!
We're all done with Bidding strategies, time to revamp your ad copy :)

Search Ads Copy
What you’ll learn
● The implications of Quality Score on ads
● The parts of an ad
● Ad copy best practices
Introduction
● Writing good ad copy is important for a few reasons.
● It’s used to calculate your Quality Score, which determines the share of
impressions you get and the cost you pay per click.
● It entices potential customers to click your ad and not one of your competitor’s
● It wards off people unlikely to convert because you pay per click
Let’s get started.

Implications of Quality Score on ad copy
In order to maximize Quality Score, you want to ensure that:

● Your ad copy relates to the keywords — maybe even repeats them.
● Your ad links to a high-quality, well-optimized page with copy related to the
keyword and ad copy.
● Your ad copy entices the RIGHT user to click (to increase click-through-rates
relative to competitors).
○ As mentioned before, you pay per click in Google, so you also don't want
to attract clicks from people who are unlikely to buy.
Keep this in mind as we dive into Search ads.

Example Search ad
This is an example of two search ads that come up when I search "accounting software "
in Canada:

As you can see, the ad:

● Repeats the brand/product name for brand recognition (QuickBooks Online)
● Repeat the keyword ("accounting software") in the text
○ “Accounting Software” (twice)
○ “/accounting/software”
● It tells you who it's for (small business)
● It pitches it with
○ Easy to use
○ Starts from $6.00 per month
○ Top-Rated
Then the landing page it links to repeats the term twice in the hero alone (and 5 times
total):

You should strive for this with every ad you write.

Anatomy of a Search ad
Let’s dive into the individual pieces of a Search ad, along with guidance on what to put
for each piece.

With Responsive Search Ads, you'll insert multiple copy variations (e.g. different
Headlines, Descriptions, etc) and Google will dynamically test which one to display.
Below are some suggestions on how to make each variation different.

Let’s see that example ad again to reference the different parts:

And note, ads can look quite different from each other. For example, this Sage ad
displays the Sitelinks quite differently, and don't have paths.

For a Search ad, you can configure the following things:

Final URL
○ This is the landing page you want the person to visit when they click your
ad.
○ The user won’t see the actual URL path; they’ll only see the hostname.
For example, if you use
https://www.demandcurve.com/pages/training/llamas , they’ll only see
http://www.demandcurve.com.
○ You control the path (e.g., /pages/training/llamas) in the ad setup, ensuring
it directs users to the most relevant page for your campaign.
Headlines (up to 3, max 30 characters each)
○ Headlines are the most prominent part of your ad and appear at the top.
You can include up to 3 headlines, and Google may dynamically combine
them to maximize relevance.
○ Best Practices:
Clearly state your business or product name and what you’re
offering (e.g., “Demand Curve – Growth Agency”).
Relate the headlines to your ad group keywords to improve
relevance.
Avoid overly branded terms unless targeting brand-specific
searches; instead, focus on value propositions or keywords users
might search for.
○ Examples:
“Demand Curve – Growth”
“Streak: Sales CRM Tool”
“Framer – UI Design”
Descriptions (up to 2, max 90 characters each)
○ Descriptions provide additional context and encourage clicks by
highlighting benefits or value propositions. You can include up to 2
descriptions, and Google may mix and match them for relevance.
○ Best Practices:
Focus on a major value proposition or social proof to stand out
(e.g., “Trusted by 500,000+ users”).
Keep the text concise but compelling, tailored to your ad group
keywords.
Ensure the descriptions complement the headlines and landing
page content.
Maybe use this space to prequalify people—for example if you are
an expensive option, state your prices.
○ Examples:
“Close more deals fast”
“Try for free today!”
Path Fields (2, max 15 characters each)
○ Path fields appear in the ad URL, after the hostname (quickbooks.com), to
provide context about the landing page (e.g.,
http://www.quickbooks.com/accounting/software)..)
○ This allows you to tweak the path to whatever your keywords are.
○ Best Practices:
Use lowercase, relevant terms that reflect the primary keywords in
your ad group
Make them descriptive but concise to improve click-through rates.
○ Examples:
growth-agency (or growth/agency)
sales-crm
ui-design
Ad Assets (Optional)
○ Enhance your ads with assets like Sitelinks, Callouts, or Structured
Snippets to provide additional information (e.g., “Free Trial,” “24/7
Support”).
○ These can improve visibility and engagement, especially for startups
targeting specific actions like sign-ups or downloads.
○ Best Practices:
Use ad assets to highlight unique selling points or urgent
calls-to-action.
Regularly review performance to optimize which assets work best
for your audience.
Legal note : Do not put other company names in your ad copy—especially your
competitors. Their brand name is likely trademarked and they could sue you for doing
so (realistically they would just send a cease and desist). Google will also reduce the
number of impressions if you include a trademarked term, even if you have explicit
permission to use it. You’d have to contact Google directly in that situation.

Limitations compared to social ad copy
Search ad copy is much more limited than the ad copy we write for social ads:

● You don’t have an accompanying ad creative (image)
● You can’t write long-form copy since you’re limited to very short blocks of text
with 30 and 90 character limits.
● You don’t have a “CTA” like “Learn more” or “Download”
● You don’t have social engagement metrics like likes and comments to improve
your ads
● You can’t be playful or casual by using emojis or casual grammar
● You're trying to match the copy to the keyword
This limits how creative you can be and forces you to be very succinct with your copy.
Layer in the fact that you need to tailor your ad copy to the keyword, and you’re left with
stating what the product is, and maybe one or two of its benefits. That’s about it.

With this in mind, the goal of your ad is to entice them enough to click by ensuring them
that your product will solve their problem.

Your landing page has the burden of selling it to them.

In short: The ad hooks, the page sells.

But there’s more you can do

Search ads have ad assets to help you get more information across. They add things
like lists of value props, links to pages on your site, or a mobile app download link.

The unfortunate part?

You can’t control if or when Google shows them—or not.

We’ll dive into ad assets in the next lesson.

Sometimes you want to discourage
clicks
Huh? Didn’t we just talk about the importance of click-through-rates on Quality Score,
and how Quality Score dictates ad performance? Doesn’t discouraging clicks go against
that?

Yes and no. Let’s dive into the two major reasons why you’d want to discourage clicks.

Reason #1: You pay per click
Unlike social ad channels like Facebook that charge you for every 1000 views (CPM),
Google charges you for every click (CPC).

No click—no cost.

So you don’t want unqualified leads, or people who simply won’t ever purchase your
product, to click your ads.

You’ll be wasting money. And you'll be wasting a lot of money if this happens frequently
AND/OR if the keywords are expensive to target (high competition).

If your product is expensive, for niche markets, or only on iOS/Mac (for example), be
very blunt about this in your ads. You don’t want people clicking if they are not your
target market.

Note : You can’t exclude people by operating system, so if you have an iOS app, you are
forced to show ads to Android users, and vice versa.

Reason #2: Quality Score is a mixture of metrics
Sure, click-through rates will go down if you discourage some people to click. But
Quality Score is also affected by the users’ landing page experience and relevance of
the ad to people’s queries.

If Google is finding that a lot of people are clicking on your ads, but bouncing quickly
from your site and don’t convert, then Google will lower your Quality Score. For
example, if you have an iOS app, and a bunch of Android users are hitting your site and
seeing a banner saying “Only on iOS,” they’ll bounce quickly.

This will hurt your Quality Score more than the dip in CTR.

So in these situations it becomes increasingly important to adjust copy so it
informs people ahead of time. And to be careful to include key negative keywords
so it excludes people. And to monitor specific keywords carefully and being
comfortable to turn them off if they're not performing well.

Time for some projects
That's enough theory and learning for now. The next few "lessons" will be projects to
update your ads with:

● Ad assets : To beef up your ads with additional info.
● UTM tags : To make tracking your ads' performance easier.
● Ad copy : To make them more likely to perform.
Let's dive in.

Project: Ad Assets
What you’ll do
● Learn what ad assets are
● Learn the types of ad assets and their best practices
● Add ad assets to your Google Ads
Introduction
Note : Way back in Q4 2022 Google rebranded 'extensions' as 'assets' in the Google
Ads UI.

Ad assets are optional add-ons that Google can display with your Search ads.

There's zero reason not to add them as they only give your ad:

● More context : They add more information to your ad, allowing you pitch the
product more, and to qualify (screen out) people better before they click. This is
important because you pay per click.
● More surface area : They make your ad larger, dominating more of the search
results area above-the-fold.
How and when Google chooses to show them, however, is a complete mystery 🤔
thanks to its blackbox algorithm.

Let’s see an ad with three types of ad assets on it:

Add as many ad assets to your ads as possible and let Google decide when to
show them.

Types of ad assets
There are various types of assets, but only a few apply to all businesses.

The following ad assets are the most universally applicable, and you should always
include them:

● Sitelink Assets
● Callout Assets
● Structured Snippet Assets
The following ad assets are only applicable to certain business types and should be
included whenever they make sense:

● Promotion Assets
● Price Assets
● Call Assets (work for Search, Display, and Mobile)
● Location Assets (work for Search, Display, and Mobile)
● App Assets
● Lead Form Assets
We’ll dive into each of these, starting with the universally applicable ones, followed by
the niche ones.

Quick aside: Do ad assets work on other Google campaign types?

(Display, YouTube, Shopping, etc?)

Ad assets have limited applicability for Shopping and YouTube ads.

They are not typically used in standard Shopping Ads, but they can be included in
Performance Max campaigns that include Shopping goals.

Similarly, ad assets are generally not used in standard YouTube video ads, but they can
appear in YouTube campaigns within Performance Max or Search campaigns with
YouTube extensions, depending on the format.

For Display ads, a variety of ad assets—including Sitelink, Callout, Image, Promotion,
Price, App, Lead Form, and Location Assets—can show across devices, including
mobile. However, Call and Location Assets are often prioritized on mobile devices for
local or service-based businesses to facilitate immediate actions like calls or directions.

Complicated, I know. But I wanted to give that context now as we won't re-teach all this
for the other campaign types.

How to add an ad asset
Ad assets can be added to the account as a whole, to specific campaigns, or to ad
groups—or all of the above.

An ad asset on a lower level will replace the assets on a higher level (for example, an
ad group asset replaces one on the account).

In this project, we will just be adding assets to the account, but the general steps are as
follows:

Go to the Google Ads dashboard.
Click to either the account (All campaigns) level, or choose a specific campaign
and/or ad group that you wish to add the asset to.
Click on the “ Assets ” option in the left-hand navigation menu.
Click the “ + ” button to create a new asset.
Select the type of ad asset you wish to add (e.g., Sitelink Asset, Callout Asset,
Structured Snippet Asset, etc.).
1. Note: Google confusingly stuffs Headlines, Descriptions, and other things
in here as well)
Fill out the asset’s requirements (e.g., text, URL, or other details depending on
the asset type).
Configure additional settings, such as scheduling or device targeting, if needed.
Click “ Save ” to apply the asset.
Phase 1: Add the universally applicable
assets
The following ad assets are helpful for every kind of business:

● Sitelink
● Callout
● Structured snippet
Add them to your account by following the recommendations below.

1a. Sitelink Assets
Sitelink assets add links to different pages on your site. They’re accompanied by titles
and descriptions of 30 characters each.

Sitelinks display in two primary ways. One is very large:

And the other is quite small:

Unfortunately, you can't control whether or how it shows. Google decides that for you.

You can notice above that Quickbooks and Sage use their sitelinks to link to pages that
either:

● Highlight specific benefits or use cases of their software
● Push people to key parts of the funnel (Pricing/Plan pages)
● Add some social proof (#1 Accounting Software)
These different links let users choose what they find most intriguing and self-identify as
a specific type of customer (one preferring Stock Management vs Mobile Accounting).

Funny secret: Not every sitelink needs to point to a different page.

In fact, they can all point to the same landing page.

You could link every sitelink to the same landing page and use them purely as a way to
expand the size of the ad and to add additional value props and context to the ad.

Some ideas for sitelinks include:

● Start Free Trial / Download
○ For those ready to take action or try your product/service.
● All Products
○ For those looking for a comprehensive list of all your offerings.
● Top Products
○ Link to the product pages of your best-selling or most popular products
(replaces “Specific products” for clarity and conciseness).
● Pricing / Plans
○ For those focused on getting answers on costs and features.
● Explore Categories
○ Let people self-select based on interests (e.g., industry, product type, or
user role), replacing “User categories — let people self select” for broader
applicability. Examples: “Tech Solutions,” “Small Business Tools.”
● Customer Support
○ Link to help pages, FAQs, or live chat to assist users with questions (new
idea for startups needing to build trust and reduce friction).
● Social Proof
○ Case studies, testimonials, or statistics to build credibility (e.g., “Trusted
Reviews,” “Success Stories”).
● Blog / Resources
○ Link to valuable content like guides, ebooks, or tutorials to attract leads
and establish authority (new idea for content-driven startups).
● Contact Us
○ Direct users to a contact form or phone number for immediate
engagement (new idea for startups prioritizing customer interaction).
● Eco-Friendly Options
○ Highlight sustainable products or practices for environmentally conscious
users (or whatever new idea reflecting current trends in consumer
behavior).
You may be tempted to make your sitelinks an asset of your sitemap by including
boring, unoptimized pages like a Team, Careers, Privacy Policy, Terms, and whatever
else.

Don’t do it.

The purpose of your ads is to drive new visitors to your site so they’re convinced to
become customers. Nothing else.

This is not a place to just list all the boring, unoptimized pages on your site.

Unless the page is likely to drive someone towards a sale, do not include it.

Also, leave out site inks for things like Log In and My Account because only current
customers/users would need to click those. You don’t want them clicking on an ad
because you pay for those clicks, and current customers will come to your site anyway.

Add a base set of sitelinks to your account now.

Then, over time you can tailor them over time to be more targeted to the individual ad
groups and their keywords.

1b. Callout Assets
Callout Assets let you create up to ten 25-character-max pieces of text that describe the
product, its value props, and any additional information. Here's an ad with both Callout
and Sitelink assets:

The Callout assets are confusingly tacked onto the end of the Description starting at
"For Every Season."

You can tell it's a Callout (instead of a description) because it's a series of ~25-character
short sentences that are just listing out value props or features.

You can only choose 4 callout assets per ad, ad group, or campaign. Note that
previously you could set up to 30 and Google would pick and choose accordingly. Now
you must set the exact 4 you want to use.

Because of this limit, you'll likely want to tailor callouts for at least the ad group level so
they can more closely match the intention and keywords of the ad group.

Callout Asset Examples

You will, of course, tailor your callouts to your product but here areSome examples are:

● Free shipping
● 14-day free trial
● Trusted by millions
● Get more leads
● Only on iOS
○ Good idea if you only have an iOS app, since you can’t exclude Android
users from your ads. This helps discourage Android users from clicking.
● Available in California — good if you're specifically targeting California in a
campaign
● Ships free to Canada — good if you're specifically targeting Canada in a
campaign

Again, the ideal is to tailor the 4 callouts to your specific ad groups.

For simplicity now, you can add a base set of 4 callouts to your account now and apply
them across the board. Then, over time, you can tailor them for each ad group.

Add your callouts now.

1c. Structured Snippet Assets
Structured Snippet Assets are lists of up to 10 values that highlight specific aspects of
your products, services, styles, or brands, organized under a predefined header (e.g.,
‘Brands,’ ‘Types,’ ‘Service Catalog’). You must include at least 3 values per header, and
Google recommends at least 4 for optimal performance.

To be honest, they don't show all that often anymore except in the perfect situation
where it's highly relevant to the search.

Here is the full list of available headers:

● Amenities
● Brands
● Courses
● Degree programs
● Destinations
● Featured hotels
● Insurance coverage
● Models
● Neighborhoods
● Service catalog
● Shows
● Styles
● Types
While you’re limited to the headers Google provides (e.g., ‘Courses,’ ‘Destinations,’
‘Brands’), not all are relevant to every business type.

For example, ‘Destinations’ is ideal for travel companies but less relevant for a SaaS
business. However, many headers, like ‘Types,’ ‘Service Catalog,’ and ‘Models,’ are
more flexible and applicable to a wide range of businesses, including SaaS and ecomm
startups.

Choose headers that most closely align with your business offerings.

● For SaaS businesses, ‘Service Catalog’ is often a good fit to list specific services
or features.
● For ecomm, consider ‘Types,’ ‘Brands,’ or ‘Models’ to showcase product
categories, brand names, or specific models.
Ensure your values are specific, relevant examples of the header (e.g., for ‘Brands,’ list
actual brands like ‘Nike, Adidas, Puma’), and include 4–10 values per header to
maximize ad performance.

Add your Structured Snippet Assets now by configuring headers and values that
match your business.

Although they don't show often, it doesn't hurt to have them

Phase 2: Add industry-specific assets
The following ad assets are only useful for specific industry/business types:

● Promotion Assets
○ If you’re an ecomm company and/or offer any deals or sales.
● Call Assets
○ If your business can justify talking to leads on the phone (e.g., for
service-based or local businesses offering phone consultations).
● Location Assets
○ If your business has a physical location (e.g., retail stores, restaurants, or
service providers with brick-and-mortar presences).
● App Assets
○ If your business has a mobile app
● Price Assets
○ If your business offers specific pricing for products or services and wants
to display costs upfront (e.g., SaaS subscriptions, e-commerce products,
or service packages).
● Lead Form Assets
○ If your business can benefit from capturing leads directly through the ad
(e.g., B2B startups, real estate, or high-consideration services requiring
contact information).
● Message Assets
○ If your business can justify engaging leads via WhatsApp messaging and
your account meets eligibility criteria (e.g., verified account, eligible
industry, WhatsApp Business setup, and availability in supported
countries, primarily on Android; limited iOS support in specific regions).
Add them to your account, if applicable, by following the recommendations below.

2a. Promotion Assets
These assets let you highlight promotions (either temporary or permanent) directly in
your Search ad.

You can configure:

● Specific occasions, such as Black Friday, New Year’s, or seasonal sales.
● Promo codes, discount details, or offers like “on orders over $100.”
● Monetary or percent discounts (e.g., “$50 Off,” “25% Off”).
● Effective date ranges (the asset will only show during these dates; Google can
suggest or automate based on performance).
● A description (up to 300 characters) to provide context, such as terms,
conditions, or urgency (e.g., “Limited Time Offer!”).
This ad asset is extremely useful for any e-commerce business that runs time-limited
promotions, such as seasonal sales or flash deals.

It’s also valuable for B2B or SaaS startups offering promotions like free trials,
limited-time discounts, or event-based offers (e.g., “Sign Up for Our Webinar and Get
20% Off”).

However, it may be less relevant for businesses without clear promotional offers unless
they run short-term discounted subscription deals or similar incentives.

Add your promotion assets now (if they work for your business).

2b. Call Assets
The Call Asset, not to be confused with Callout Assets, adds your company’s phone
number directly to the ad, allowing people to call you directly with a single click.

Callout Assets, by contrast, are non-clickable text highlighting benefits or features.

You can configure:

● Your business phone number (must be a valid, verifiable number linked to your
account).
● A call tracking number (optional) to measure call conversions and integrate with
reporting tools like Google Analytics.
● Scheduling (e.g., show the call button only during business hours).
● Device targeting (e.g., prioritize mobile devices, where calls are more likely,
though you can enable it on all devices if relevant).
Call Assets are highly useful for businesses that can justify generating leads or sales via
phone calls. They are particularly valuable for:

● Businesses with physical locations, like stores, restaurants, or service providers
(e.g., plumbers, electricians).
● Local services dealing with urgent needs or targeting demographics that prefer
phone communication, such as older customers.
● Startups or businesses with high-value contracts or consultations (e.g., B2B, real
estate, or professional services) where a phone call can close a deal or qualify a
lead.
You might consider Call Assets for businesses needing direct customer engagement,
like e-commerce companies offering phone-based sales or consultations. However, they
may be less suitable for existing customer support inquiries, as those clicks could be
costly and better handled through organic results or your website directly. Focus on
using Call Assets for new lead generation rather than customer service to maximize
ROI.

Add your call assets now (if they work for your business).

2c. Location Assets
Location Assets are for businesses with physical locations or service areas who want
their location information to be added to their Search ads, enhancing visibility on Google
Maps and driving local traffic.

To add a Location Asset, you need to have a Google Business Profile (formerly Google
My Business) account with your location information filled out, or you can manually
enter and verify location data in Google Ads. Then, you configure the asset in the
“Assets” section of Google Ads, and Google can automatically associate locations
based on your profile or campaign targeting.

This asset lets users:

● See how far away your location is.
● See the address.
● Click to get directions via Google Maps.
● Click to call your business (if a phone number is provided).
● View additional details, such as business hours, star ratings, or photos (if
available from your Google Business Profile).
Location Assets are highly useful for businesses with physical storefronts (e.g., retail
stores, restaurants) or service-area businesses (e.g., plumbers, landscapers) targeting
local customers. They help drive foot traffic, provide context for nearby users, and
improve ad relevance for location-based searches.

Add your Location Assets now (if they apply to your business), ensuring your Google
Business Profile is verified and up-to-date for optimal performance.

2d. App Assets
App Assets allow people to see and click a link directly to your mobile app in the Apple
App Store or Google Play Store, driving installs or engagement. These assets typically
display a button (e.g., “Download now,” “Get now”) along with your app icon, name, and
rating (if available), enhancing visibility for app-driven businesses.

App Assets are particularly valuable for startups with mobile apps, as they prime users
with the knowledge that your product is app-based before they visit your website. While
click-through rates may vary, well-targeted App Assets can significantly boost app
installs and engagement, especially in Search, Display, or Performance Max campaigns
targeting mobile users. They help attract users who prefer app-based experiences or
need your app for full functionality.

You can configure:

● Your app links for both iOS (App Store) and Android (Google Play) platforms.
● A call-to-action (CTA) text, such as “Download,” “Install,” “Get now,” or “Open”
(up to 25 characters).
● Scheduling and device targeting (e.g., prioritize mobile devices) to optimize
performance.
There’s minimal customization beyond linking your app and choosing the CTA, but
Google’s automation can dynamically optimize the asset based on performance and
user behavior.

Add your App Assets now (if your business has a mobile app).

2e. Price Assets
Price Assets allow you to display specific pricing for your products or services directly in
your Search ad, helping users understand costs upfront and driving informed clicks.

You can configure:

● Specific prices for products, services, or plans (e.g., “Starter: $49,” “Pro:
$199/mo”).
● A description (up to 300 characters) to provide context, such as terms,
conditions, or value propositions (e.g., “Includes unlimited access,” “30-day
money-back guarantee”).
● Scheduling (e.g., show only during promotional periods) or device targeting to
optimize visibility.
Price Assets are highly useful for e-commerce businesses, SaaS startups, or service
providers offering clear pricing (e.g., subscription plans, product costs, or package

rates). They’re less relevant for businesses without fixed or transparent pricing unless
offering promotions or bundles.

Add your Price Assets now (if they apply to your business).

2f. Lead Form Assets
Lead Form Assets help you generate leads by letting people submit their information
directly in your ad, without requiring them to visit a landing page. This streamlined
process makes it easier for startups to capture high-quality leads efficiently, especially
for B2B companies or businesses targeting lead generation.

You can configure:

● A headline (up to 30 characters) to serve as your primary call to action on the
form (e.g., “Request Quote,” “Sign Up Now”).
● A business name (up to 30 characters) displayed at the top of the form.
● A description (up to 200–300 characters) to provide context, detail your offer, and
encourage submissions (e.g., “Get a personalized demo—fast & free!”).
● Custom questions (up to 10 fields) to collect contact information (e.g., name,
email, phone) and work details (e.g., company size, industry), which can be
pre-filled if the user is signed into their Google account.
● A call-to-action (CTA) button (e.g., “Get Quote,” “Sign Up,” “Request Info”) to
prompt users to submit the form.
● A post-submit call-to-action (e.g., “Visit Our Site,” “Learn More”) and URL to
direct users after submission.
● Optimization settings to target either “More volume” (default, for higher lead
quantity) or “More qualified” (for higher lead quality), without changing audiences
or form fields.
● A privacy policy link, required to comply with data collection guidelines and
ensure transparency about how lead data will be used.
Lead Form Assets are highly useful for startups looking to generate leads quickly and
efficiently, particularly in Search, Display, Discovery, and Video campaigns (Video is
currently in beta, available only on Android mobile devices). They’re ideal for:

● B2B startups offering consultations, demos, or quotes (e.g., software, consulting,
or professional services).
● Service-based businesses (e.g., real estate, insurance, or financial services)
needing to capture potential client information.
● E-commerce or SaaS companies running promotional offers or free trials to
attract leads.
To use Lead Form Assets, your account must meet these requirements:

● A Google Ads account in an eligible vertical (e.g., non-sensitive sectors like retail,
services, or B2B; sensitive verticals like sexual content or political content are
excluded).
● Reputable advertisers spending more than $1,000 USD per account (or more
than $15,000 USD across all accounts) may be eligible, subject to account status
verification and good standing. For Video, Display, or Discovery campaigns, a
lifetime spend of over $50,000 USD is required.
● A conversion-focused bidding strategy (e.g., Maximize Conversions, Target CPA)
and a Google lead form conversion goal in the campaign, even if optimizing for
other conversions.
● At least one responsive search ad, responsive display ad, or Discovery image ad
(depending on the campaign type); expanded text ads and uploaded image ads
are ineligible.
Benefits and Limitations:

● Benefits : Easy setup, ability to download leads as a CSV file or integrate with
your CRM via webhook, great for capturing first-party data, and an easier user
experience if your website isn’t optimized for conversions.
● Limitations : Limited customization compared to landing pages, potential for
lower-quality leads due to the simplified process, data privacy concerns (users
may hesitate to share info), and restrictions on campaign types (e.g., not
available for Shopping campaigns).
Add your Lead Form Assets now (if they’re applicable and your account meets the
eligibility criteria).

2g. Message Assets
Message Assets are similar to Call Assets in that they facilitate direct communication
with users.

They give users an opportunity to initiate a WhatsApp conversation by clicking the ad
asset, allowing real-time engagement. Note that Message Assets are currently in beta,
so they may not be available to all accounts.

You can configure:

● Your WhatsApp phone number
● A call-to-action (CTA) text (up to 25 characters, e.g., “Chat Now,” “Message Us”).
● A default WhatsApp message (up to 300 characters) that users can edit before
sending, such as “I’d like to know more about the growth marketing course.”
Message Assets are highly useful for businesses that can justify engaging leads or
customers via WhatsApp, particularly in regions where WhatsApp is widely used (e.g.,
parts of Europe, Asia, Latin America). They are especially valuable for:

● Startups or service-based businesses targeting real-time communication for lead
generation, sales, or customer support.
● E-commerce or B2B companies in eligible regions looking to offer instant
assistance or personalized outreach.
To use Message Assets, your account must meet eligibility criteria, including:

● A verified Google Ads account.
● A WhatsApp Business account with a valid phone number, properly configured in
Google Ads.
● Availability in supported countries (primarily Android; limited iOS support in
specific regions).
● An eligible industry (e.g., non-sensitive sectors like retail or services, but not
campaigns/elections).
Add your Message Assets now (if they’re available and applicable for your business and
region).

Great, now let's add UTMs
Project: UTM Tags
Prerequisite
Make sure you’ve done our UTM reading ( Acquisition > UTM Tags ) first.

What you’ll do
● Add UTM tags to your Google Ads using tracking templates
● Create custom parameters to use in your tracking templates
Introduction
Unlike other ad channels, which require manual entry of UTM tags for every ad, Google
Ads lets you create a tracking template that automatically fills UTM tags and attaches
them, along with other query parameters, to your ad URLs.

This saves significant time and hassle for startups managing multiple campaigns.

With tracking templates, you set the template once, and Google Ads automatically fills
in values for source, medium, campaign, content, term, and any other query parameters
you specify for every ad it displays.

In this lesson, we’ll cover how to set up tracking templates and how best to customize
them to meet your startup’s needs.

Auto-tagging
Google Ads automatically tags your ad URLs with a gclid (Google Click ID) parameter.
This gclid tells Google Analytics and other Google products everything they need to
track users, such as the source, medium, campaign, content, and term, without
requiring manual UTM tags. When a user clicks an ad, the URL might look like this:
https://www.demandcurve.com/?gclid=123456789.

While the gclid is designed to simplify tracking within Google ecosystems, it
doesn’t eliminate the need for UTM tags. The gclid data is only available to Google
products like Google Analytics, meaning non-Google tools (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude,
Hotjar) can’t use this information. Therefore, you should still add UTM tags to your
Google Ads URLs using tracking templates to ensure comprehensive tracking across all
your analytics platforms.

Tracking templates don’t overwrite the gclid, so you’ll still see the default UTM values in
Google Analytics, even with a tracking template set.

The default UTM values for Google Ads are:

● Source: google
● Medium: cpc (for Search campaigns; can vary as display , video , or shopping
for other campaign types)
● Campaign: the Google Ads campaign name
● Term: the keyword that triggered the ad
● Content: the ad ID
For startups, we recommend being specific with the medium and setting it as search,
display, youtube, or shopping for different Google Ads campaign types. Being specific
allows you to better group and analyze the performance of each campaign type.
However, you can choose to leave the medium as cpc if you want to keep things simple
and consolidate data.

Tracking templates
Hierarchy
You can apply tracking templates at the account, campaign, ad group, or ad level in
Google Ads. Any tracking template applied at a lower level overwrites one at a higher

level. For example, a campaign-level template overwrites an account-level template, an
ad group-level template overwrites a campaign-level one, and so on.

When setting up a new Google Ads account for a startup, we always create a tracking
template for the entire account as a default, typically for Search campaigns, since they
often make up the bulk of traffic and campaigns. For any campaign or ad group that
doesn’t follow this format (e.g., Display, YouTube, or Shopping campaigns), we
overwrite it with a different tracking template to ensure the utm_medium reflects the
correct campaign type (e.g., display , youtube , shopping ).

Variables in tracking templates
Tracking templates let you set both static values and dynamic variables. Static values
remain constant, while dynamic variables (called ValueTrack parameters) are
automatically filled by Google Ads when an ad is displayed. Here’s a basic tracking
template example:

{lpurl}?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign={campaignid}
&utm_term={keyword}&utm_content={creative}

This will look like this in Google Ads:

Note:

● Anything within curly brackets (e.g., {lpurl} , {campaignid} ) is a ValueTrack
parameter that Google dynamically fills based on the ad’s context.
● Everything else (e.g., utm_source=google , utm_medium=search ) is statically
defined and remains the same.
Google automatically provides these ValueTrack parameters:

● {lpurl} : The URL of your landing page (always include this to ensure ads link
correctly; without it, ad links will break).
● {campaignid} : The 10-digit ID of the campaign (e.g., 1543683531; viewable in
Google Ads under the “Campaign ID” column in Attributes).
● {keyword} : The keyword that triggered the ad.
● {creative} : The ID of the ad (not user-friendly, but available for tracking).
One challenge is that you can’t use the name of the ad, campaign, or ad group
directly—only their IDs, which can be confusing for someone reviewing analytics (e.g.,
seeing utm_campaign=513216432 without knowing the actual campaign name).

To address this, you can create custom parameters in Google Ads to insert
human-readable names.

Custom parameters
A custom parameter is inserted using curly brackets, always starting with an underscore
(e.g., {_stcam} , {_stadg} ). By convention, they often start with “st” (e.g., _stcam for
campaign, _stadg for ad group), but this isn’t mandatory—startups can use any prefix
(e.g., _myparam).

Here’s an example tracking template using custom parameters:

{lpurl}?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign={stcam}{_st
adg}&utm_term={keyword}&utm_content={creative}

In this format, utm_campaign combines the campaign name ( {_stcam} ) and ad
group name ( {_stadg} ) for more detailed tracking, such as
[CampaignName]_[AdGroupName]. This provides clearer insights into where users
are coming from in your analytics tools.

This is what it will look like in Google Ads:

Note on {creative} : The {creative} parameter refers to the ad ID, which isn’t
user-friendly (e.g., a numeric ID like 12345). While you could create another custom
parameter (e.g., {_stad} for ad name), this requires manual setup for each ad and is
often less useful or practical for startups. We typically recommend focusing on
campaign and ad group names for simplicity, but you’re welcome to add ad-specific
custom parameters if needed.

Phase 1: Create custom parameters
● In Google Ads, navigate to the campaign or ad group settings under “ URL
options ” or “ Tracking ,” and add custom parameters in the “ Custom
parameters ” section. Define {_stcam} as the campaign name and {_stadg} as
the ad group name, ensuring they’re manually set or dynamically pulled from
your campaign structure.
○ You can't put a space into a URL normally, so make sure you’ve encoded
your campaign name (see Google Ads – Additional Resources > Search
Ads: URL Encoding)
● You can also use the Google Ads Editor or API to manage custom parameters
efficiently, reducing manual effort for startups.
Phase 2: Setting tracking templates
Now that we have the custom parameters in place, let’s learn how to add the tracking
template both at the account level and at lower levels.

Account
Click Settings in the sidebar
Click Account Settings
Expand Tracking
Paste in this code in the template
1. {lpurl}?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign={
stcam}{_stadg}&utm_term={keyword}&utm_content={creative}
Click Test and see the URLs that pop up. Click on one to make sure it goes
where you want and looks how you want. Make sure the right words pop up in
the URL.
Click Save
The tracking template above is for Search campaigns. You will need to customize it for
Display, Shopping, and YouTube campaigns by changing the utm_medium to display,
shopping, and youtube when you set the tracking template at the campaign level.

Also remember that Google gives you the lpurl, keyword, and creative — so you don’t
have to set those up.

Campaign/Ad Group
You only need to do this if you want to overwrite the URLs you set on the account. For
example, if you want to change the utm_medium to display for a Display campaign.

Adding a tracking template to a campaign or ad group is similar to adding a custom
parameter. Follow the steps to set a custom parameter from Phase 1, but add the
Tracking template column instead, and paste in the following code:

{lpurl}?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign={stcam}{_st
adg}&utm_term={keyword}&utm_content={creative}

Make sure to customize the utm_medium based on the actual campaign type (display
vs shopping vs youtube).

Mark Incomplete

Project: Search Ads Copy
What you’ll do
● Create Responsive Search Ads (RSAs) for your ad groups
● Use bulk actions to speed up the process where applicable
What you need
● Access to your Google Ads account
● Successful completion of:
○ Our initial search ads project
○ Our keyword project
Introduction
In this project, you’ll create ads for your Google Ads campaign(s), enabling you to
launch them and measure performance.

We’re adopting a modern, streamlined approach with one or more campaigns
containing ad groups targeting three key concepts:

● High Intent Searches : Users ready to buy or engage (e.g., branded terms,
specific product queries).
● Problem-Solution Searches : Users seeking answers to pain points your
product solves.
● Competitors : Users searching for rival brands or solutions.
Each ad group’s copy will align with its targeting focus. With RSAs, you’ll input multiple
headlines (up to 15) and descriptions (up to 4) per ad, letting Google dynamically test
and optimize combinations. Aim for 10–15 headlines and 3–4 descriptions per RSA to
maximize flexibility.

To start, draft your copy directly in the Google Ads interface to preview it in context.
Optionally, save it in a Google Doc for feedback and future reference. Let’s dive in.

How to Create an Responsive Search Ad
In Google Ads, go to All Campaigns > Ads & Assets > Ads.
Click the blue + > + Responsive Search Ad.
Select your campaign and ad group.
Enter your copy:
○ Headlines : 10–15 variations (e.g., “EcoClean – Green Cleaning,” “Natural
Detergent by EcoClean”).
○ Descriptions : 3–4 variations (e.g., “Discover EcoClean’s sustainable
cleaning products.”).
Pin brand-specific headlines to Position 1 (hover over the headline, click the pin
icon) if desired.
Add your Business Name and Logo
Add any relevant Ad Assets
Save the ad.
It should look something like this:

Phase 1: Write Ads for High Intent Searches
High Intent ad groups target users with clear purchase or engagement intent—often
your brand name, product names, or specific services.

Tailor your RSAs to these keywords for relevance and Quality Score boosts.

Example: Service-Focused Ad Group

For a startup like “EcoClean” (offering sustainable cleaning supplies), target terms like:

● Sustainable Detergent
● eco-friendly cleaner
● best eco-friendly cleaner
Tips:

● Include service-specific keywords in headlines and descriptions for relevance.
● Highlight local availability, expertise, or unique benefits (e.g., “Trusted Local
Landscapers”).
● Keep copy clear and concise—avoid overstuffing keywords, focusing on user
intent.
Example RSA for EcoClean

● Headlines:
○ EcoClean – Green Cleaning
○ Sustainable Detergent Online
○ Trusted Eco-Friendly Cleaner
● Descriptions:
○ EcoClean offers natural cleaning products for a greener home.
○ Shop sustainable solutions trusted by eco-conscious households.
● Path: /green-cleaning
Start with 1–2 RSAs per ad group to test messaging while consolidating impressions.

Phase 2: Write Ads for Problem-Solution Searches
These ad groups target users searching for solutions to specific problems your product
addresses. Focus on pain points and benefits rather than brand terms alone.

Example: Problem-Solution Ad Group

For EcoClean, target terms like:

● Eco-friendly stain remover
● Non-toxic cleaner for kids
● Sustainable cleaning alternatives
Tips:

● Address the problem (e.g., “Tough Stains?”) and solution (e.g., “Try Our Natural
Formula”).
● Use benefit-driven language (e.g., “Safe for Families”).
Example RSA

● Headlines:
○ Tough Stains? Go Green
○ Non-Toxic Cleaning Power
○ EcoClean Solves Messes
● Descriptions:
○ Remove stains with EcoClean’s safe, natural formula.
○ Clean sustainably without harmful chemicals.
● Path: /natural-solutions
Phase 3: Write Ads for Competitor Searches
Competitor ad groups target users searching for rival brands. You can bid on their
keywords but cannot use their names in ad copy (to avoid trademark issues). Be
subtle and strategic.

Example: Competitor Ad Group

If EcoClean competes with “CleanWorks” and "GreenWorks" target terms like:

● GreenWorks alternative
● Cleanworks alternative
● Cleanworks eco-friendly
Tips:

● Echo competitor terminology (e.g., “plant-based” if they use it).
● Highlight differentiation (e.g., price, features, or unique benefits like “100%
Plastic-Free”).
● Take shots at the enemy's weakness (chemicals vs all natural)
Example RSA

● Headlines:
○ Ditch the chemicals
○ All natural cleaner
● Descriptions:
○ Switch to a 100% plastic-free, natural cleaner today.
○ Cleaner homes with eco-friendly power—shop now.
● Path: /eco-alternative
Phase 4: Create the Ads in Google Ads
Continue this process for all your campaigns and ad groups.

Make sure your ads are still paused just in case!

Final Notes
● How how many ads per ad group? Start with 1–2 RSAs per ad group to test
messaging efficiently, especially with a modest testing budget. Scale to 3 only if
impression volume supports it later.
● Ad strength: Aim for “Good” or “Excellent” by varying headlines and including
keywords naturally.
Okay, now to dive a little bit into Google's targeting options.

Google Ads Targeting and Structuring
What you’ll learn
● The targeting options available for campaigns and ad groups, and how to use
them effectively.
● Recommendations for structuring campaigns and ad groups to maximize
performance.
Introduction
How you structure your Google Ads campaigns and ad groups depends on your:

● Keyword themes,
● Targeting goals, and
● Budget.
This lesson explores the targeting options available and provides a streamlined, modern
approach for structuring your account—perfect for a startup testing Google Ads.

While targeting can feel complex, we’ll keep it simple and actionable for beginners.

Campaign Targeting
At the campaign level, you can target two primary options: locations and languages.
These settings shape who sees your ads and are interconnected.

Locations
● Why it matters : Targeting the right locations ensures you reach potential
customers while avoiding wasted spend on irrelevant areas.
● For ecom or local businesses : If you sell physical products or services in
specific regions (e.g., the United States), target only those countries, states, or
cities where you operate.
○ See the bullet point below about "People In vs People Interested In"
● For SaaS or global products : If your product can be used worldwide (e.g., a
$1,000/month SaaS tool), consider targeting “Tier 1” and “Tier 2” markets—major
English-speaking countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand),
Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark), Western Europe (Germany, France,
Netherlands), and parts of Eastern Asia (e.g., Singapore, Hong Kong). Avoid
low-conversion regions like Latin America, Africa, India, etc, unless you have
data showing viability.
● Targeting states and cities : If you're spending >$10k per month, you should
target specific states, provinces, or major cities (e.g., US states, Canadian
provinces, London, Paris) to analyze performance by region. Use Google Ads’
location reports to refine spending later.
○ Do that by choosing Enter another location and adding them in
separately.
● People In vs. People Interested In :

○ Default: “Presence or interest” includes users in your target location or
those showing interest (e.g., researching a trip or reading about the area).
○ Recommendation : Set to “Presence: People in or regularly in your
targeted locations” to target only people who are actually in that space,
reducing irrelevant clicks. You’ll miss some travelers or unlocatable users,
but this trade-off improves efficiency.
● Excluding locations : Exclude areas where you can’t or won’t serve (e.g., Alaska
or Hawaii for a US-based product unavailable there). Use “People in your
excluded locations” to avoid targeting researchers or travelers from those areas.
○ To exclude, you need to do Enter another location then type the location
and select Exclude
Languages
Language targeting is generally based on the language the user’s computer or browser
is set to—not necessarily the languages they speak or understand.

This means Google targets users based on device or browser settings, which can
sometimes lead to mismatches (e.g., a non-English speaker using an English browser
might see English ads).

● Why it matters : Language targeting ensures your ads match users’ language
preferences, improving relevance and conversions.
● Modern approach : Use “All languages” for high-English-fluency countries (e.g.,
US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway,
Denmark) if your ads and landing pages are in English. Non-English speakers in
these regions often use English fluently and convert well.
● For lower-English-fluency countries : Target only English (e.g., Germany,
France, South Korea, Finland, Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel) unless
you have multilingual ads and landing pages.
○ To do that, you'll need to create a separate campaign from your main
ones.
● Avoid overcomplicating : Don’t create separate campaigns for each language
unless you have a very large budget and proven ROI from Google Ads—and if
your site/product also tailors to that language. Google’s data shows English-only
targeting performs well in high-fluency regions, simplifying management.
Campaign and Ad Group Targeting
Beyond campaigns, you can refine targeting at the ad group or campaign level with
these options:

Audiences/Remarketing Lists
● Target specific audiences (e.g., website visitors, past customers, or in-market
segments) to reach users more likely to convert.
● Use Google Ads’ audience suggestions (e.g., “Home & Garden” for landscaping
services) or custom remarketing lists (e.g., users who visited your pricing page).
○ You can either "target" or "observe" these audiences. We recommend
setting it to Observe for now, which will let you see the relative
performance. If one under- or over-performs, act accordingly.
● Keep it simple for beginners—start with broad in-market or affinity audiences,
then refine based on performance.
Devices
● Target desktops, mobile phones, or tablets, but note: You can’t exclude devices
entirely—you must adjust bids (e.g., “Decrease by 100%” to exclude).
○ Use device bid adjustments (e.g., +20% for mobile if conversions are
higher) rather than strict exclusions. Google’s machine learning often
handles device optimization effectively, especially with Smart Bidding
(e.g., Target CPA or Maximize Conversions).
● You can’t target by operating system (e.g., iOS, Android) or browser, but address
this in ad copy (e.g., “Download our iOS app now”).
● Oddly you get there by going Insights and reports then When and where ads
showed
Ad Schedules
● Google automatically analyzes performance by day of the week and hour of day.
Use this data to adjust bids for high-performing times (e.g., +20% during
weekdays for B2B products).
● Avoid custom schedules unless you have clear data showing specific times
outperform (e.g., work hours for B2B) or for whatever reason your product
shouldn't be promoted at certain times. For startups, leave schedules
open—intent-based searches can occur anytime, even at 3 a.m. on weekends.
Demographics (Gender, Age, Household Income)
In the Audiences, keywords, and content -> Audiences you can edit a few things
including the demographics targeted on specific ad groups.

● Gender : Target “Female,” “Male,” or “Unknown” (e.g., untracked, minors, or
non-binary users). Start broad (all genders) unless your product is clearly
gender-specific (e.g., exclude men for feminine hygiene products). Optimize later
based on data.
● Age : Target ranges like 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65+, or “Unknown.”
For most products, focus on 25–54 (the “sweet spot” for spending power and
tech adoption). Exclude 18–24 (low conversion rates) and 55+ (less likely to
adopt new tech online) unless your product targets those groups.
● Household Income : Use categories like “Lower 50%,” “Top 41–50%,” etc. Start
broad unless your product is niche or expensive (e.g., exclude “Lower 50%” for a
luxury product). The 11–50% range often performs best for mass-market or
mid-range products.
Campaign Structuring
Modern Google Ads structuring prioritizes simplicity, scalability, and Google’s
automation.

Here’s how to structure campaigns and ad groups for a startup testing the channel:

Why create separate campaigns?
Different budget needs : Separate campaigns for distinct goals (e.g., High Intent
Searches, Problem-Solution Searches, Competitors) to control budgets
independently. Google allocates your daily budget across a campaign’s ad
groups, so splitting ensures no single keyword or location overspends (e.g., India
dominating due to high volume).
Unique targeting : Use separate campaigns for different locations, languages, or
demographics if they require distinct strategies (e.g., US vs. UK, English vs.
non-English regions). However, keep it simple for beginners—start with one
campaign covering key markets.
Testing strategies : Create separate campaigns to test bidding strategies (e.g.,
Target CPA for conversions, Maximize Clicks for traffic) or ad formats (e.g., RSAs
vs. Performance Max).
Ad group structuring
● Tight themes : Group keywords by intent and theme within ad groups (e.g.,
“landscaping services,” “landscaper near me” for High Intent). Use 5–15 closely
related keywords per ad group to maintain relevance and Quality Score.
● Avoid SKAGs : Single Keyword Ad Groups are an outdated thing. Modern
accounts group broad match keywords into tight themes and use Responsive
Search Ads, letting Google’s machine learning optimize dynamically.
Examples

You could either create one big campaign like we suggested earlier, or you can break
the different ad group types into separate campaigns so you can have several ad
groups and control the budgets.

That could look

● Campaign 1: Landscaping Services (High Intent)
○ Ad Group 1: “Landscaping Services” (keywords: landscaping services,
professional lawn care, yard maintenance).
○ Ad Group 2: “Local Landscapers” (keywords: landscaper near me, local
lawn care, nearby landscaping).
● Campaign 2: Problem-Solution Searches
○ Ad Group 1: “Lawn Maintenance” (keywords: lawn maintenance services)
○ Ad Group 2: "Fix Dying Lawn" (keywords: fix patchy lawn, lawn restoration
services, green lawn tips).
● Campaign 3: Competitors
○ Ad Group 1: “Competitor Alternatives” (keywords: better than [Competitor
X], [Competitor X] alternative, eco-friendly landscaping).
Keeping it simple for startups

● Start with 1–2 campaigns covering your key markets (e.g., US, CA) and intent
types (High Intent, Problem-Solution, Competitors).
● Target “All languages” or English in high-fluency regions and focus on key
states/cities.
● Use broad demographics (25–54, all genders, 11–50% income—unless you
target even more broadly than that) initially, narrowing based on data.
● Don’t split into dozens of campaigns upfront—test with either one campaign, or
single campaign per intent type, then expand as you scale and prove ROI.
● Use Smart Bidding (e.g., Target CPA, Maximize Conversions) to let Google
optimize bids dynamically across devices, times, and locations.
Okay, now with that, you understand the targeting options

Google Ads Audiences
What You’ll Do
● Learn what remarketing lists (now called “audience lists” in Google Ads) are and
the types available.
● Understand how to use them effectively across Search, Display, and
Performance Max campaigns.
● Create audience lists and add them to your campaigns.
Introduction
In Google Ads, the Audiences tab allows you to create and manage audience lists
(formerly remarketing lists) to target or exclude specific groups of people based on their
interactions with your website, app, YouTube channel, or search behavior. These
interactions include actions like signing up for your mailing list, making a purchase, or
visiting key pages, as well as how recently they performed those actions (e.g., 30, 60, or
365 days).

Audience lists enable you to:

● Exclude current or past customers to avoid wasting ad spend on people who
already know you.
● Retarget unconverted visitors or past customers with tailored ads across Search,
Display, or YouTube.
● Prospect for new customers similar to your best audiences using “Similar
Audiences” or “Custom Audiences.”
● Optimize bids and targeting for high-value users, leveraging Google’s
automation.
While audience lists are powerful for Display and YouTube campaigns, they’re also
valuable for Search and Performance Max campaigns, especially for exclusions and bid
optimization. Before launching ads, set up audience lists to target the right people
efficiently.

Note: You can’t access personally identifiable information about users on these
lists—they’re used solely for targeting purposes.

Let’s explore the types of audience lists and how to use them effectively.

Types of lists
Google Ads offers several ways to create audience lists, most of which are
automatically generated. You can set how long a user remains on a list (e.g., 30 days,
90 days, or unlimited). Here are the main types:

1. Website Visitors (Based on URL or Pages)

● How It Works : Automatically create lists of users who visit specific pages on
your website (e.g., /cart, /checkout, /confirmation, /pricing).
● Best Use : Target or exclude users based on their website behavior, such as
visitors who viewed your pricing page but didn’t convert.
● Tip : Use Google Tag Manager or the Google Ads tag to track page visits. Avoid
relying solely on URLs, as they can change—use events or conversions for
reliability (see “Conversion Events” below).
● Membership Duration : Set a duration (e.g., 30–365 days) based on how long
users remain relevant (e.g., 30 days for cart abandoners, 100+ days for
purchasers—depending on product).
2. Conversion Events (Preferred for Automation)

● How It Works : Automatically generate lists of users who complete specific
conversion actions you’ve defined (e.g., purchases, sign-ups, form submissions).
● Best Use : This is the easiest and most reliable method for creating retargeting
lists, especially for future customers. It integrates seamlessly with Google
Analytics 4 (GA4) or Google Ads conversion tracking.
● Tip : Use GA4 events or Google Ads conversion goals to track actions like
“Purchase” or “Add to Cart,” then create audience lists based on these events.
This is more accurate than manual tags and scales easily.
● Membership Duration : Set based on your product and customer lifecycle (e.g.,
30 days for cart abandoners, 100+ days for purchasers—depending on product).
3. App Users

● How It Works : Automatically create lists of users who have downloaded or
interacted with your mobile app (e.g., installed, made an in-app purchase).
● Best Use : Target or exclude app users for app install campaigns, retargeting, or
cross-channel promotions (e.g., pushing app users to your website).
● Tip : Use Firebase or Google Ads app tracking to set up these lists, ensuring
accurate attribution across devices.
4. YouTube Users

● How It Works : Automatically generate lists of users who watched videos on your
YouTube channel (e.g., viewed 25% or more of a video, subscribed).
● Best Use : Retarget YouTube viewers with Display, YouTube, or Search ads, or
exclude converted viewers.
● Tip : Combine with Performance Max or Video campaigns for broader reach.
5. Customer Lists (For Current/Past Users)

● How It Works : Upload a list of customer data (e.g., email addresses) to match
with Google accounts. You can set a membership duration (e.g., 30 days, 60
days, or unlimited).
● Best Use : Exclude current or past customers from campaigns to avoid redundant
ad spend, or retarget lapsed customers (e.g., those who haven’t purchased in
90+ days).
● Limitations : This list doesn’t update automatically—you must manually refresh it
with new data or rely on conversion-based lists for ongoing tracking.
● Tip : Use Google Ads’ Customer Match feature, which supports email, phone
numbers, or mailing addresses, and integrates with GA4 for better automation.
6. Similar Audiences (Lookalike Audiences)

● How It Works : Google automatically creates lists of users with behaviors and
interests similar to your existing audience lists (e.g., customers, converters, or
website visitors).
● Best Use : Prospect for new customers in Display, Search, or Performance Max
campaigns, as these audiences often convert well due to Google’s extensive
data.
● Tip : Combine with in-market or affinity audiences for even better results, and use
Smart Bidding to optimize bids for these segments.
How to use Audient Lists effectively
Audience lists are versatile and can enhance performance across Search, Display,
YouTube, and Performance Max campaigns.

Here’s how to use them strategically, with a focus on automation and modern practices:

Search
● Exclude converted users
○ Avoid paying for clicks from current or past customers who already know
your brand. Use a combination of customer lists (uploaded emails) and
conversion-based lists (e.g., “Purchased in the last 30 days”) to exclude
these users.
○ Focus on key conversion events like purchases or sign-ups. For
unconverted users (e.g., cart abandoners), keep showing ads to drive
them back—don’t exclude them yet.
○ Tip : Use “Observation” mode initially to track performance, then switch to
“Targeting” (exclude) if data shows savings without losing conversions.
● Optimize bids for high-value audiences
○ Use audience lists to bid higher on users more likely to convert,
such as website visitors who didn’t convert or users deep in your
funnel (e.g., “Added to Cart”).
○ With Smart Bidding (e.g., Target CPA, Maximize Conversions),
Google automatically adjusts bids for these audiences based on
performance—no manual bid increases (e.g., 25–50%) needed.
○ Set membership durations (e.g., 30 days for recent visitors, 90 days
for cart abandoners) to keep lists relevant.
Display/YouTube
● Exclude converted users
○ Same as Search—exclude current customers or recent converters to save
budget. Use customer lists or conversion-based lists (e.g., “Purchased >
30 days ago”).
○ Tip : Combine with frequency capping to limit ad exposure to these users.
● Run retargeting campaigns for unconverted visitors
○ Target website visitors, YouTube viewers, or app users who didn’t convert
with tailored Display or YouTube ads. Offer incentives like discounts or
reminders (e.g., “Complete Your Purchase Today”).
○ Break into segments for precision, such as:
■ <30-day website visitors who didn’t sign up or purchase.
■ 31–60-day visitors who abandoned carts.
○ Use Smart Bidding to optimize bids, and test ad formats (e.g., responsive
display ads, video ads) for engagement.
● Retarget lapsed customers
○ Create lists of customers who haven’t engaged or purchased recently
(e.g., >45 days for a product bought monthly). Retarget with Display or
YouTube ads to re-engage them.
○ Example : For a landscaping service, retarget customers who haven’t
booked maintenance in 60+ days with seasonal offers.
● Prospect with "Similar Audiences"
○ Use “Similar Audiences” to reach new users with behaviors like your best
customers. Combine with in-market or affinity audiences for broader
reach.
○ Tip : Test in Performance Max campaigns for cross-channel optimization
(Search, Display, YouTube, Discover).
For Performance Max Campaigns
● Leverage All Audience Types :
○ Use website visitors, conversion events, customer lists, and similar
audiences to refine targeting within Performance Max campaigns, which
span Search, Display, YouTube, and more.
○ Exclude converted users and bid higher on high-value segments (e.g., cart
abandoners, past visitors) using Smart Bidding.
○ Tip : Performance Max automatically optimizes across audiences, so use
“Observation” mode initially, then refine based on performance data.
How to Create and Add Audience Lists
to Campaigns
Follow these steps to set up and apply audience lists in Google Ads:

1. Create Audience Lists

● Go to Audiences :
○ In Google Ads, click Tools & Settings > Shared Library > Audience
Manager.
○ Click the blue + button to create a new audience.
● Choose a Type :
○ Website Visitors : Select “Website visitors” and specify URLs or use
Google Analytics events (e.g., “Visited /cart”).
○ Conversion Events : Use tracked conversions (e.g., “Purchase,”
“Sign-Up”) to auto-generate lists.
○ Customer Lists : Upload a CSV or use Customer Match with emails,
phone numbers, or addresses.
○ App Users/YouTube Users : Select the relevant platform and define
actions (e.g., “Watched 25% of video”).
○ Similar Audiences : Let Google create lists based on existing audiences.
● Set Membership Duration :
○ Choose how long users stay on the list (e.g., 30 days for recent visitors,
180 days for customers).
● Save the Audience :
○ Name the list (e.g., “Cart Abandoners – 30 Days”) and save it.
2. Add Audiences to Campaigns

● Campaign or Ad Group Level :
Go to the campaign or ad group > Audiences tab.
Click the blue + button to add audiences.
Select your created lists (e.g., “Cart Abandoners,” “Past Customers”).
Choose “Targeting” (show ads only to these audiences) or “Observation”
(track performance but show ads to everyone).
Save changes.
3. Monitor and Optimize
● Use the Audiences report in Google Ads to analyze performance (e.g.,
conversions, cost, CTR) by audience segment.
● Adjust targeting or bidding after 30–60 days based on data, or let Smart Bidding
optimize automatically.
Tips
● Start simple : For a budget under $10K/month, create 2–3 key audience lists
(e.g., “Website Visitors – 30 Days,” “Purchased – Exclude,” “Similar to
Customers”) and use “Observation” mode to track performance without restricting
traffic.
● Leverage automation : Use Smart Bidding (e.g., Target CPA, Maximize
Conversions) to optimize bids for audiences dynamically, reducing manual
adjustments.
● Focus on high-value segments : Prioritize lists like cart abandoners, pricing
page visitors, or lapsed customers, as they’re more likely to convert with
retargeting.
● Integrate with GA4 : Use Google Analytics 4 to track events and create audience
lists automatically, syncing with Google Ads for better accuracy.
Now get to implementing!
Project: Launch!
Overview

Now that you’ve created a paused Google Ads campaign with multiple ad groups, and
learned about keywords, ad copy, targeting, audiences, and optimization strategies, it’s
time to launch your campaign and start driving results.

This project guides you through activating your campaign, setting an initial budget,
choosing a bidding strategy, and monitoring early performance to ensure a successful
launch testing Google Ads.

Phase 1: Prepare to launch your campaign
Before launching, ensure your campaign is fully configured and paused:

● Verify all ad groups, keywords (using Broad Match), Responsive Search Ads, ad
assets (extensions), targeting (locations, languages, audiences), and conversion
tracking are set up as learned in previous lessons.
● Double-check negative keywords and audience exclusions (e.g., exclude
converted customers) to minimize wasted spend.
● Confirm your landing pages are live, relevant, and mobile-friendly, especially for
high-intent searches like “landscaping services” or “landscaper near me.”
Phase 2: Set your budget and bidding strategy
Choose a budget and bidding approach that aligns with your startup’s goals and
constraints.

Budget guidance

● Initial test budget : Allocate $2,000–$5,000 for a 30–to 60-day test to evaluate
profitability across your campaign and ad groups. This ensures sufficient data
(e.g., 50+ conversions) for Google’s machine learning to optimize effectively.
● Daily budget : Set a daily budget based on your total test amount (e.g.,
$67–$167/day for a $2,000–$5,000 monthly budget).
○ Note: the more campaigns, products, ad groups, keywords, and locations
you test, either the more budget you need, or the longer you'll need to test,
as you'll be spreading the budget over more variables.
○ Note: the more expensive your product is or the longer your sales cycle,
the more budget you'll need or the longer you'll need to test.
● Scalability : If ads prove profitable (or promising) don't just double or triple the
budget suddenly or else you'll risk spiking CPAs and tanking ROAS.
○ Instead, scale the budget by 20-50% every 14-30 days. If your initial
budget is $3,000/month ($100/day), scale to $3,600–$4,500/month
($120–$150/day) after 30 days of profitability (e.g., CPA $45, ROAS
350%).
○ Avoid exceeding 50% at once to prevent overspending on untested
segments—monitor CPA and ROAS closely.
Bidding strategy

● Use Smart Bidding : Select an automated strategy like Target CPA (e.g., $50 if
willing to pay $50 per conversion), Target ROAS (e.g., 300% if aiming for $3
revenue per $1 spent), or Maximize Conversions (to drive as many conversions
as possible within your budget).
○ Avoid manual bidding strategies (e.g., Manual CPC, Enhanced CPC), as
they’re outdated for modern SEM—Google’s machine learning optimizes
better with Broad Match and automation.
● Adjust targets later : Start with conservative targets (e.g., higher CPA initially to
gather data), then refine downward after 30–60 days based on performance.
Phase 3: Launch your campaign
● Activate the campaign :
○ In Google Ads, go to Campaigns , select your paused campaign
○ Click the campaign status (paused) and set it to Enabled.
○ Verify all ad groups, ads, and assets are active and error-free.
● Monitor initial performance :
○ Check the campaign daily for the first week to ensure ads serve, budgets
aren’t overspent, and no technical issues arise (e.g., disapproved ads,
tracking errors).
○ Use columns like impressions, clicks, CTR, conversions, and CPA to
monitor early results.
● Avoid over-optimizing : Resist making changes in the first 7–14 days—Google
needs time to learn and optimize with Broad Match and Smart Bidding.
Phase 4: Optimize
Now that you're launched, use the next lessons to learn how to optimize them over time!

Project: Prepare to Optimize Google Ads
What you’ll learn
● The procedure to optimize Google Search campaigns over time
● How to evaluate performance
● How to improve performance and save money
● How to use Search Terms to add keywords and negative keywords to your ad
groups
● How to use segmentation to dive deeper into data
What is optimizing Google Ads?
Optimizing Google Ads is the process of selectively turning off or de-prioritizing things
that don’t work (or don’t work as well as you’d like), and adding to (or prioritizing) things
that do work.

This can be:

● Keywords
● Ads
● Assets (extensions)
● Demographics
● Locations
● Devices
● And more
For example: you may find that the keyword "design tool" for your UI design tool is
triggering ads for clothing, building, and stage design tools, so you’d want to stop
targeting clothing , building , and stage.

You may also find that people in Washington convert twice as well as people anywhere
else in the country, so you may want to prioritize them.

Phase 1: Choose success metrics
Before optimizing, establish clear goals. Answer these questions in a document, notes
app, or spreadsheet:

What conversion metric will you optimize for?

● Identify your primary conversion goal (e.g., sign-up, purchase, upgrade). This
should match the conversion event tracked in Google Ads (set in your tracking
setup).
● If your purchase conversion has a long lag (e.g., weeks or months due to a free
trial or complex sales cycle), use an intermediary metric like “sign-up” or “lead
form submission.” This provides Google with short-term data to optimize toward
(50+ conversions per campaign in 30 days is ideal for Smart Bidding).
● Example: For a landscaping service, optimize for “Booking Confirmation” if
purchases happen quickly, or “Quote Request” if the sales cycle is longer.
What’s your Target Cost Per Conversion/Acquisition (CPA) or Return on Ad
Spend (ROAS)?

● Decide how much you’re willing to pay per conversion (e.g., $50 CPA for a lead)
or what ROAS you expect (e.g., 300% ROAS, meaning $3 revenue per $1
spent).
● Are you okay with higher costs initially to gather data and optimize, or do you
need profitability immediately? For startups, testing often requires a higher CPA
upfront (e.g., $75–$100) to learn, then refine downward.
How much are you willing to spend to test Google Ads?

● Budget $2,000–$5,000 for initial testing to evaluate profitability across ad groups
and keywords. This ensures you gather enough data (e.g., 50+ conversions) to
assess performance confidently.
○ You should not expect to make money on this initial testing.
● If that's not feasible, then do a small budget (e.g., < $1,000/month), and focus on
high-intent keywords and key locations to maximize impact.
If ads are profitable (or close to), what’s your monthly spend target?

● Base this on your payback period (e.g., how long it takes to recoup ad spend
through revenue).
○ If you have an ecomm business and payback is instantaneous, you can
scale quick.
○ If you have an expensive service or software business and it takes weeks
to months, then scale more slowly.
Phase 2: Configure your columns for
performance insights
To evaluate performance effectively, customize your Google Ads columns for quick,
actionable insights.

● How to modify columns :
○ In Google Ads, go to Campaigns , Ad Groups , or Keywords (depending
on your focus).
○ Click Columns > Modify Columns.
● Set up key metrics :
○ Configure columns to include the following (prioritize based on your
goals):
■ Impressions : How often your ads are shown.
■ Clicks : User interactions with your ads.
■ CTR (Click-Through Rate) : Engagement rate (clicks/impressions).
■ Conversions : Number of completed conversion actions (e.g.,
purchases, sign-ups).
■ Cost : Total spend.
■ Cost/Conv. (CPA) : Cost per conversion—critical if optimizing for
non-revenue conversions (e.g., sign-ups).
■ Conv. Value/Cost (ROAS) : Return on ad spend—key if your
conversions log revenue (e.g., $500/booked job).
■ Conversion Rate : Percentage of clicks that lead to conversions.
● Tailor to your goals :
○ If your primary conversion (e.g., “Purchase”) logs revenue, focus on Conv.
Value/Cost and Conv. Value to maximize ROAS.
○ If your conversion (e.g., “Sign-Up”) lacks revenue, prioritize Cost/Conv.
(CPA) and Conversions to minimize cost and maximize volume.
● Use segmentation for deeper analysis :
○ Click Segment > Conversions > Conversion Action to break down data
by specific conversion types (e.g., “Purchase,” “Sign-Up”).
○ Segment by other dimensions (e.g., device, location, day of week) to
uncover trends (e.g., mobile converts better on weekends).
As you can see in this example, only the Signup event is recording in Conversions ,
and all others are being recorded under All conv.

All conv will also include the number of View-through conversions (people who
converted after seeing your ad, even if they didn’t click on it).

Conversions doesn’t include view-throughs. View-throughs are only relevant for
Display and YouTube ads. In the example above, even though we’re considering the
Signup conversion to be the most important (because of a long time delay between ad
click and Purchase conversion), we’re still interested in seeing how many people are
completing each step. It lets us see if there’s a big drop off in the funnel, and whether
people engage with a specific campaign or keyword.

Phase 3: Evaluate performance (think small and
data-driven)
When reviewing performance, focus on granular data before making broad changes.
Don’t panic if a campaign spends $500 with no conversions—drill down to keywords, ad
groups, or segments.

1. Start at the Keyword Level
○ Check the Keywords tab for each ad group. Look at spend,
conversions, CPA, and ROAS for individual keywords.
○ Example: If “design tool” spends $50 with no conversions but
triggers irrelevant clicks (e.g., clothing or stage design), add
**negative keywords like “clothing” or “stage.”

Analyze Ad Groups** :
○ Review performance across ad groups (e.g., “Landscaping Services,”
“Landscaper Near Me”). Pause or adjust underperforming ad groups (e.g.,
CPA > $100, 0 conversions after $200 spent).
○ Do this sparingly. Only do this if every keyword in the ad group is
underperforming.
3. Segment Data for Insights :
○ Use segmentation (e.g., Segment > Device , Location , Demographics )
to identify trends:
■ But be careful as it's generally best to let Google's algorithm figure
it out, but if you reach significant spend and trends emerge, it may
be worth manually adjusting bids.
■ Example: If after lots of spend, California consistently drives
conversions at a $40 CPA while other states average $80 increase
bids or focus budget on California.
4. Check Search Terms :
○ Go to Keywords > Search Terms to see what users actually searched for
when triggering your ads.
○ Note that Search Terms doesn't show all searches, just some of them, due
to privacy concerns.
○ Add high-performing search terms as new keywords (e.g., “local lawn
care” if it converts well).
○ Add negative keywords for irrelevant terms (e.g., “free landscaping” if it
doesn’t align with your paid service).
5. Pause Underperformers : Pause keywords, ads, or ad groups with:
○ CPA > target (e.g., >$150 if your target is $50).
○ 0 conversions after spending 2–3x your target CPA (e.g., $150 spent with
no conversions).
○ Low CTR (<1%) after 1,000+ impressions.
6. Scale Winners :
○ If an ad group is outperforming others, consider moving it its own
campaign so you can increase its budget relative to everything else.
○ Test variations (e.g., new headlines, similar keywords) to expand reach
while maintaining profitability.

Phase 4: Use automation for long-term success
Google’s machine learning is more effective than manual optimization over time.

Follow these steps:

Stick with Smart Bidding :
○ Use Target CPA or Target ROAS for campaigns, letting Google adjust
bids dynamically across all segments (keywords, audiences, devices,
locations).
○ Remove manual bid adjustments—they’re ignored or counterproductive
with automated strategies.
Monitor Performance Regularly :
○ Review performance weekly or biweekly, focusing on conversions, CPA,
and ROAS.
■ Increase the frequency the more you spend.
○ Use the Recommendations tab in Google Ads for automated suggestions
(e.g., add negative keywords, optimize bids).
Expand with Performance Max :
○ Once Search campaigns prove profitable, test Performance Max
campaigns to scale across Search, Display, YouTube, and Discover, using
audience lists and automation for broader reach.
Tips for startups
● Start small : With a budget of $2,000–$5,000, focus on 1–2 campaigns with 3–5
ad groups targeting high-intent keywords (e.g., “landscaping services,”
“landscaper near me”).
● Leverage automation : Use Smart Bidding from day one—don’t rely on manual
strategies like Manual CPC or Enhanced CPC, which are outdated for most
accounts.
● Wait for data : Allow 30–60 days (or 50+ conversions per campaign) before
making major changes. Google needs time to learn and optimize.
● Prioritize high-intent segments : Focus on locations, devices, and audiences
driving conversions, avoiding low-intent or irrelevant traffic.
Yeehaw!

Project: Optimize Google Ads
Overview
When evaluating your Google Ads campaigns, optimize from the lowest level (search
terms, keywords) to the highest (campaigns). Pausing a poorly performing campaign
might seem tempting, but digging deeper often reveals one underperforming keyword
dragging down the rest, leaving profitable opportunities behind.

Here’s the recommended order for evaluating and optimizing Google Ads:

● Search terms
● Keywords
● Ads
● Ad assets (extensions)
● Audiences (demographics, locations, ad schedules)
● Devices
● Bid strategies
● Ad groups
● Campaigns
Each section below details how to optimize that element and suggests how often to
focus on it. The frequency depends on your impression, click, and conversion volume.
With low volume (e.g., 100 clicks/month across 100 keywords), data accumulation takes
longer—adjust these guidelines based on your account’s activity.

Phase 0: Start a log
Before optimizing, maintain a Google Doc or spreadsheet to log major changes and
rationales.

Here’s an example we used internally for a real client (this example is for Facebook, but
the format is the same).

This helps track performance after adjustments, such as adding negative keywords or
tweaking ad copy. For example:

● Exclude “starter kit” as a negative keyword across campaigns.
○ Rationale: We’ve spent $500 with no conversions, and it’s low-intent.
Phase 1: Search Terms
When: Every time you optimize.

Analyzing search terms is one of the most critical optimization for Google Ads,
especially early in a campaign. It reveals the actual queries triggering your ads, helping
you find new keywords and identify irrelevant searches for negative keywords.

In modern SEM, Google primarily uses Broad Match keywords, relying on its machine
learning to match queries to your ads based on intent, context, and user behavior. For
example, for a UI design tool like Framer, a Broad Match keyword like “design tool”

might trigger searches like “UI design software” or “best design tool for websites”—but
also irrelevant queries like “clothing design tool” or “tool for designing a building.” To
stop wasting money on irrelevance, add “clothing,” “clothes,” “shirts,” and “building” as
negative keywords.

You can also reassign high-performing search terms to better-suited ad groups or
campaigns. For instance, if a keyword in a high-intent ad group triggers one that is
better suited for a problem-solution ad group, then add it as a keyword to the other ad
group and add a negative keyword to its current one.

Procedure for finding negative keywords
Navigate to the campaign or ad group you want to optimize.
Set the time range from your last review to today (e.g., last 7–14 days).
Click Insights and reports > Search terms in the left navigation.
Scroll through the list and select irrelevant queries, such as:
○ Searches for entirely different industries or products (e.g., “college design
program” for a UI tool, “graphic design program” if irrelevant, “windows
design program” if your product is Mac-only).
○ Low-intent queries with words like “what is,” “how to,” “example,” “lesson,”
“course,” “tutorial,” or “torrent.”
○ Keywords better suited for different ad groups.
Click Add as negative keyword.
Choose where to add it (e.g., ad group, campaign, or shared negative keyword
list).
○ Add broadly (e.g., campaign level) to reduce repetition, but ensure it won’t
harm other ad groups.
○ For account-wide irrelevance, use the “All Campaigns” negative keyword
list.
Click Save and repeat for other ad groups.
Procedure for positive keywords
Scroll through the search terms and identify relevant, high-performing queries
(e.g., “UI design tool,” “best design software” for Framer).
Use these insights to:
○ Update ad copy or landing pages to align with common searches,
improving relevance and Quality Score.
○ You probably don't need to worry about adding too many minor keyword
variations as Broad Match dynamically captures them, but do it if they're
quite different and are performing well.
Click Save and repeat for other ad groups.
Phase 2: Keywords
When: Every time you optimize

Continuously refine your Broad Match keywords to focus on winners and pause losers,
leveraging Google’s automation and data.

Phase 2a: Adjust current keywords
● Review keyword performance over at least the last 14 days using columns like
impressions, clicks, conversions, CPA, and ROAS.
● With automated bidding (e.g., Target CPA, Target ROAS, Maximize
Conversions):
○ Let Google handle bid adjustments dynamically—don’t manually adjust
bids.
○ Pause Broad Match keywords consistently exceeding your target CPA
(e.g., >$150 if your target is $50) after spending 2–3x the target CPA (e.g.,
$150 spent with no conversions).
● Use segmentation (e.g., device, location, demographics) to identify
high-performing segments and refine targeting if needed (e.g., increase focus on
mobile if it converts better).
● Avoid pausing keywords too early—wait for sufficient data (50+
conversions/campaign over 30 days) to ensure confidence in performance.
Phase 2b: Add more keywords/ad groups
If you identify keywords that are performing well that follow a certain trend, consider
breaking it out into its own ad group and tailor the ad copy to the specific keywords.

Or if you identify

Phase 2c: Create new landing pages (optional)
● If certain keywords or ad groups perform significantly better, consider creating
landing pages optimized for those terms (e.g., “Landscaping Services Near Me”
page).
● Update ad destinations to point to these pages, improving Quality Score,
lowering CPCs, and boosting conversions.
● Monitor performance after changes—new pages don’t always outperform existing
ones.
Phase 3: Ads
When: Every time you optimize

Optimize ads by refining ad copy (e.g., Responsive Search Ads) based on performance.
Google prioritizes high-performing ads dynamically, so focus on top performers and
pause underperformers.

Procedure
Select an ad group.
Set the time range to at least 14 days (or between today and your last
optimization).
Click Ads & Assets > Ads.
Filter out paused or removed ads.
Sort by % Served (ascending) to identify poorly performing ads.
Pause ads with <5–10% served (adjust based on the number of ads
running—remove those barely shown).
Sort by Cost (descending) to find high-cost, low-conversion ads.
Pause ads if others perform >20% better in conversions or CPA.
Sort by Cost/Conv. (ascending) to identify top performers.
Duplicate top-performing ads and test variations (e.g., new headlines,
descriptions) to improve performance.
Create entirely new ad variations inspired by best performers, focusing on
relevance and intent aligned with Broad Match queries.
Save changes and repeat for other ad groups.
Phase 4: Ad Assets
When: Every month.

Optimize ad extensions (e.g., sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets) at the campaign or
ad group level, as performance varies. Track performance to ensure extensions improve
CPA or ROAS.

Procedure
Go to a campaign or ad group
Change the time range to be at least 30 days
Take note of the average CPA for the campaign/ad group by scrolling down to
bottom and looking at Cost / conv.
Click Assets > Assets in left-nav.
Make note of the average CPA for the extension types by scrolling down to
bottom and looking at Cost / conv.
Pick an Asset type. E.g., Callout. (If it’s overwhelming to look at all your assets
at once.)
Remove any obvious poor performers (CPA much higher, CTR much lower).
Identify top performers and come up with variations of these top performers and
add them to the campaign/ad group directly.
Repeat for all other asset types you have running.
Repeat for all other campaigns/ad groups.
Phase 5: Audiences
When: Every month.

Optimize audiences (demographics, locations, ad schedules) to focus on
high-performing segments while excluding underperformers. Use Google’s automation
for efficiency.

Procedure

Select an ad group or campaign (use campaigns for locations, ad groups for
demographics).
Set the time range to at least 30 days.
Navigate to Audiences , Locations , or Ad Schedule in the sidebar.
Analyze performance using CPA, conversions, or ROAS.
With automated bidding (e.g., Target CPA, Target ROAS):
Let Google optimize bids dynamically—don’t manually adjust.
Pause or exclude segments consistently exceeding your target CPA (e.g.,
locations or demographics with no conversions after spending 2–3x your
target CPA).
Use segmentation to identify trends (e.g., 25–54-year-olds in California convert
best).
If performance varies drastically (e.g., women 25–34 convert 50% better),
consider breaking into separate campaigns or ad groups for greater control over
budgets, keywords, and ad copy.
Repeat for all ad groups/campaigns.
Phase 6: Devices
When: Every month.

Optimize device performance, considering website usability if one device underperforms
(e.g., tablets or mobiles).

Procedure

Select an ad group.
Set the time range to at least 30 days.
Click Insights and reporst > When and where ads showed in the sidebar.
Review performance (CPA, conversions, ROAS) for desktops, mobiles, and
tablets.
If a device (e.g., tablets) performs significantly worse, test your landing page on
that device:
1. Check usability (e.g., mobile responsiveness, load speed).
2. Suggest improvements to your team (e.g., optimize for smaller screens, fix
navigation).
If usability isn’t the issue, optimize normally:
With automated bidding, let Google optimize bids—pause devices
exceeding your target CPA after sufficient data keeping in mind you're
significantly reducing your total market.
Phase 7: Ad groups
When: Check every time. But do this as a last resort.

If search terms, keywords, ads, and targeting are optimized but an ad group still
underperforms, consider pausing it.

● Review ad group performance (CPA, conversions, ROAS) over 30+ days.
● Pause ad groups with:
○ CPA > target (e.g., >$100 if your target is $50).
○ 0 conversions after spending 2–3x your target CPA (e.g., $150 spent).
● Create new landing pages for high-performing ad groups to boost relevance and
Quality Score, then monitor performance.
● Try to determine if there's other ad groups you can launch that you're currently
not targeting.
Again, this should be a last resort and only if all keywords are underperforming in an ad
group.

Phase 8: Campaigns
When: Check every time, but do as last resort.

If all ad groups fail or you want to prioritize better-performing campaigns, pause the
underperforming campaign.

● Review campaign performance (CPA, conversions, ROAS) over 30+ days.
● Pause campaigns with:
○ Consistent CPA > target (e.g., >$100 if your target is $50).
○ 0 conversions after spending 2–3x your target CPA (e.g., $1,500 spent on
a $500/day budget).
● Focus budget on profitable campaigns and scale with Performance Max for
broader reach once Search proves viable.
Phase 9: Budgets
Okay, now that you've optimized all the things, here's how to scale your budgets over
time.

1. Confirm profitability and stability (30–60 days)

● Ensure your initial campaign(s) meets your success metric (e.g., $50 CPA, 300%
ROAS).
● Verify consistent performance across ad groups, keywords, and segments
● Use the Campaigns , Ad Groups , and Keywords reports to confirm 50+
conversions per campaign over 30 days, ensuring Google’s machine learning
has stabilized.
2. Increase budget incrementally (20–50% at a time)

● Rule : Increase your daily or monthly budget by 20–50% every 14–30 days,
depending on performance.
○ Example: If your initial budget is $3,000/month ($100/day), scale to
$3,600–$4,500/month ($120–$150/day) after 30 days of profitability (e.g.,
CPA $45, ROAS 350%).
○ Avoid exceeding 50% at once to prevent overspending on untested
segments—monitor CPA and ROAS closely.
● When to pause : If CPA spikes >20% above target (e.g., >$60 for a $50 target) or
ROAS drops >20% (e.g., <240% for a 300% goal) after scaling, pause the
increase, analyze performance (e.g., Search Terms, devices), and refine (e.g.,
add negative keywords, adjust targeting).
3. Expand targeting strategically

● Locations : Add new high-potential locations (e.g., Texas, Florida) after proving
profitability in key markets (e.g., California). Start with 1–2 new
states/provinces/countries, scaling 20–50% of budget there, and monitor for 30
days.
○ Example: If California performs at $40 CPA, test Texas with 25% of your
budget ($25/day of $100/day), pausing if CPA exceeds $60.
● Audiences : Expand to similar or in-market audiences (e.g., “Home & Garden,”
“Home Improvement Enthusiasts”) after proving success with website visitors or
converters. Use “Observation” mode initially, then switch to “Targeting” if
performance holds.
4. Test new campaign types (e.g., Performance Max)

● Rule : After 60+ days of profitable Search campaigns, allocate 20–30% of your
budget to a Performance Max campaign to scale across Search, Display,
YouTube, and Discover.
○ Example: With a $5,000/month Search budget, launch a Performance Max
campaign with $1,000–$1,500/month, targeting the same high-intent
audience (e.g., landscaping) and monitoring for 30 days.
● When to scale : If Performance Max achieves CPA ≤ target and ROAS ≥ goal,
increase its budget by 20–50% monthly, up to 50% of total spend, while
maintaining Search profitability.
5. Monitor payback period and ROI

● Rule : Scale only if your payback period (time to recoup ad spend via revenue) is
within a timeframe to support your scaling.
○ Example: If each $50 CPA conversion yields $500 revenue in 30 days,
scale confidently—your ROAS is 1,000%, and payback is immediate.
○ If instead, your $500 CPA gives you $1000 in one year, that could get
quite expensive to support scaling over time.
● Pause if unprofitable : If payback exceeds your target (e.g., >60 days), pause
scaling, optimize (e.g., pause underperforming locations, refine Broad Match),
and reassess after 30 days.
6. Cap scaling at sustainable levels

● Rule : Limit total monthly spend to 2–3x your initial test budget
($4,000–$15,000/month) until you confirm long-term profitability (e.g., 90+ days
of consistent ROAS >300%, CPA <$50).
○ Example: From a $5,000 test budget, scale to $10,000–$15,000/month
over 3–6 months, monitoring CPA and ROAS monthly.
● Reassess regularly : Review performance quarterly, adjusting budgets,
targeting, and campaign types based on ROI and market changes.
Tips for startups
● Start small : With a $2,000–$5,000 budget, test 1–2 campaigns with 3–5 ad
groups targeting high-intent Broad Match keywords (e.g., “landscaping services,”
“landscaper near me”).
● Leverage automation : Use Smart Bidding from day one—avoid manual
strategies like Manual CPC, which are outdated for most accounts.
● Wait for data : Allow 30–60 days (or 50+ conversions/campaign) before major
changes. Google needs time to learn and optimize with Broad Match.
● Focus on high-intent segments : Prioritize locations, devices, and audiences
driving conversions, avoiding low-intent or irrelevant traffic by refining Broad
Match with negative keywords.
Search Ads – URL Encoding
What you set in your UTM tags is exactly the URL that ads used.

Meaning if you have a space or something in your UTMs, it could break the URL.

To prevent that, you'll want to “URL encode” it so it doesn’t break. Essentially, you
replace all spaces and special characters (!$%&@, etc.) with something a browser can
understand.

For example, this URL would break because of the spaces and exclamation point:

https://www.fictitiousdogfood.com/?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=pet
products&utm_medium=search&utm_content=healthiest dog
food!&utm_term=best healthy dog foods

But this one wouldn’t:

https://www.fictitiousdogfood.com/?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=pet%20p
roducts&utm_medium=search&utm_content=healthiest%20dog%20food%21&utm
_term=best%20healthy%20dog%20foods

Note the %20 (spaces) and %21 (exclamation mark).

So, for example, the utm_campaign of pet products would turn into pet%20products.

How do you encode URLs quickly?

Use this URL encoding tool. Put the name of your campaign (or ad group, or whatever
you’re trying to encode) in.

Copy-paste the result when you’re making a URL.

Search Ads – Advanced Campaign
Structure Examples
Normal
We always follow this template and structure for our campaigns:

Campaign: Search – Core Keywords

● Ad Group 1: High-Intent Purchase Keywords
○ Keywords : Broad match terms like “buy [product]”, “[product] pricing”:
■ buy grass-fed lamb dog food
■ high protein dog food for active dogs
■ best raw lamb dog food
■ grain-free lamb dog food
○ Ad Copy : Strong CTA, price-based offers
■ Headline 1: "Grass-Fed Lamb Dog Food – Free Shipping!"
■ Headline 2: "High-Protein, Grain-Free – Vet Approved"
■ Description: "Try our all-natural, grass-fed lamb chow. Great for
sensitive stomachs. Order now & get 10% off!"
○ Landing Page: Product page or homepage (depending on product)
● Ad Group 2: Problem-Solution Keywords
○ Keywords : “[problem] solution”, “best [product] for [use case]”
■ best dog food for allergies
■ dog food for sensitive stomachs
■ healthy raw diet for dogs
■ best dog food for coat health
○ Ad Copy : Focus on pain points, problem-solving
■ Headline 1: "Sensitive Stomach? Try Grass-Fed Lamb!"
■ Headline 2: "Vet Recommended for Allergy-Prone Dogs"
■ Description: "Our lamb-based formula supports digestion & skin
health. See the difference in 30 days!"
○ Landing page: Talk directly to the problem and solution (allergies)
● Ad Group 3: Competitor Terms (Optional)
○ Keywords : Competitor brand names + qualifiers like “alternative”
■ Blue Buffalo lamb dog food alternative
■ Orijen lamb dog food vs
■ best Honest Kitchen dog food alternative
■ is Stella & Chewy’s good for dogs
○ Ad Copy : Positioning against competitors
■ Headline 1: "Better Than [Competitor]? Try This!"
■ Headline 2: "Grass-Fed Lamb – No Artificial Fillers"
■ Description: "More meat, no fillers, and healthier digestion.
Compare us to [Competitor] & see why dogs love it!"
○ Landing Page : Comparison page
Note: This campaign only has 3 ad groups but it could have more if there are more
specific problem-solution or high-intent searches

More complicated
As discussed we might want to create more campaigns if:

● We want to control the budget more tightly across certain ad groups or locations
● We have a lot of different products
● We want to tailor campaigns to specific languages
● We have a lot of different ad groups and want to couple them more tightly
● We have different conversion goals across different ad groups (purchase vs book
a webinar)
Obviously this could greatly increase the number of campaigns and looks different for
different companies so we won't go into too much detail into one specific type.

Introduction: Performance Max
Overview

Now that you’ve created and launched a standalone Google Search Ads campaign, it’s
time to explore Performance Max (PMax), Google’s advanced campaign type that

integrates your Search efforts with Display, YouTube, Shopping, Gmail, and Discover
ads.

This module will guide you through leveraging PMax to enhance conversions, build
brand awareness, and scale efficiently, complementing your Search campaign with
minimal effort. If you need a partner after completing this course, our ads agency can
assist.

Questions answered in this module

● What is Performance Max, and how does it complement my Search Ads?
● Should my startup use Performance Max?
● How do I create effective PMax campaigns?
What is Performance Max?

Performance Max (PMax) is Google’s most powerful campaign type, using its advanced
AI and machine learning to optimize ads across multiple channels—Search, Display,
YouTube, Shopping, Gmail, and Discover—based on your goals (e.g., conversions,
brand awareness).

It's honestly so powerful that we often don't recommend running dedicated Display and
YouTube campaigns unless you have very specific reasons to do so.

If you really want, you can get it create all the assets for you by automatically grabbing
information from your website. Everything here was autogenerated by Google:

And it automatically will generate:

Of course, they might not be the best but it's a great starting point.

Building on your existing Search campaign (e.g., targeting “landscaping services,”
“landscaper near me”), PMax enhances performance by:

● Search Ads : Reinforces high-intent text ads on Google search results, capturing
users searching for your services.
● Display Ads : Delivers visual banners, images, or videos on websites, apps, and
videos in the Google Display Network (GDN) for brand awareness and
remarketing.
● Shopping Ads : Directly promotes your ecommerce products directly in Google's
properties.
● YouTube Ads : Runs video or skippable ads on YouTube for engagement and
reach, targeting users interested in your industry.
● Gmail and Discover Ads : Shows personalized ads in Gmail inboxes and
Google Discover feeds for broader exposure.
PMax uses Broad Match keywords, Responsive Ads (Search, Display, YouTube), and
Smart Bidding (e.g., Target CPA, Target ROAS) to automate targeting, bidding, and ad
creation, requiring only high-quality assets and clear goals. It complements your Search
campaign by driving lower-intent traffic (Display, YouTube) while maintaining high-intent
conversions (Search).

PMax builds on your Search campaign, adding Display and YouTube for broader reach
and remarketing, with minimal additional setup.

And it leverages Google's full algorithmic power, letting it use its trillions of data points to
decide when, where, and what to show people in hopes of getting them to convert.

PMax can help increase the efficiency of your existing Search Ads, and may eventually
nearly replace it entirely.

What Performance Max is best for

PMax excels for startups with these characteristics:

● Growth goals : Ideal for driving conversions (Search), brand awareness (Display,
YouTube), and remarketing (all channels), not just immediate sales.
● Visual appeal : Products with strong visuals (e.g., landscaping services, UI
design tools) benefit from Display and YouTube Ads, while Search Ads target
high-intent queries.
● Limited resources : Perfect for founders without design or SEM
expertise—PMax requires minimal assets and automates targeting, bidding, and
optimization, complementing your Search setup.
● Competitive niches : If Search CPCs are high (e.g., >$10/click for insurance,
education), PMax’s Display and YouTube components lower CPA by reaching
broader audiences at lower CPMs, driving Search-qualified traffic indirectly.
Users across channels have varied intent—high for Search (“landscaper near me”), low
for Display/YouTube (browsing content)—but PMax’s in-market audiences, affinity
segments, and remarketing lists ensure relevance, enhancing your Search
performance.

Recommendations

● Launch PMax after Search : With your Search campaign running, add a PMax
campaign, uploading 3–5 images, 5 headlines, 5 descriptions, and optional
videos—Google auto-optimizes Search, Display, and YouTube for conversions
and awareness.
● Use Smart Bidding : Rely on Target CPA, Target ROAS, or Maximize
Conversions to optimize bids dynamically across channels, reducing manual
adjustments and syncing with your Search strategy.
● Target strategically : Use in-market audiences (e.g., “Home & Garden” for
landscaping), affinity audiences (e.g., “Home Improvement Enthusiasts”), and
remarketing lists (e.g., Search visitors) to reach relevant users cost-effectively,
complementing Search targeting.
● Start small, scale gradually : Allocate 20–30% of your total budget
($600–$1,500/month) to PMax initially, monitor CPA and ROAS for 30–60 days,
then scale to 30–50% ($1,500–$3,000/month) if profitable (e.g., CPA ≤$50,
ROAS ≥300%).
● Integrate with Search : Pair PMax with your Search Ads (e.g., 80/20 split) to
lower overall CPA and boost brand awareness, using Smart Bidding for synergy
across channels.
Final notes

Performance Max uses the full power of the Google algorithm to run your ads. You give
up a ton of control and insight but more often than not get rewarded with more
conversions and a better CPA/ROAS.

Let's dive deeper into how to run PMax effectively.

Performance Max Account Structure
Performance Max (PMax) integrates Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, and Discover
ads into a single, automated campaign, leveraging Google’s machine learning to
optimize for your goals (e.g., conversions, brand awareness).

In this lesson we'll dive into how PMax is structured, the assets you feed into it, and
your targeting options available.

Spoiler: There isn't a ton you can configure—and that's a good thing. Google's
algorithm knows best, so the goal of PMax is to feed it assets and data and let
Google do its thing.

What you feed into PMax
PMax uses responsive, dynamic ad formats across channels, requiring minimal setup
while maximizing performance.

Your job is to feed it a mix of text, images, and video. ThenGoogle’s machine learning
tests thousands of combinations to deliver the best results.

Campaign options
Like other campaign types, with PMax you configure these main things at the campaign
level:

● Budget
● Location
● Languages
● Ad schedule
● Bid type
This is effectively the same as Search Ads so we won't cover them in detail.

Asset groups, not ad groups or ads
PMax doesn't have ad groups or ads. Instead, you create Assets Groups which are a
combination of:

● Assets (text, image, video, ad assets)
● Products (if an ecomm company)
● Targeting
○ Search themes
○ Audience signal
Assets

Here's a list of all the assets you feed into PMax (the more the better):

Products

If you are an ecomm company with products, you can leverage Shopping Ads directly
within Performance Max.

Note, we also have a Shopping Ads module as we often recommend starting with a
dedicated Shopping campaign and only expanding into Performance Max as you scale
the account.

To do this, you need a Google Merchant Center account populated with your products
and connected to Google Ads. Performance Max will then use them at its discretion to
drive conversions.

See instructions in Project; Google Merchant Center.

Targeting

PMax uses what it calls "signals."

These aren't explicit targeting options but instead signals you want to give Google to
give it a general idea of the type of people you're looking for.

These break down into two types:

● Search themes: Think of them like Keywords
● Audience signals: Think of these as Audiences.
Search themes

You can list upwards of 25 search themes (a.k.a. keywords):

This is pretty simple and I would come up with at least 10-15 targeted and related
keywords much like you would for ad groups in Search Ads.

Audience signals

This is much like the Audience targeting covered in Search where you either use your
own data or you use Google's built in audience types and demographics:

That's about it
So at the campaign level you can set your budget, location, and language targeting, and
then you create some assets groups that target specific keyword and/or audience
grouping.

In the next lesson, we'll walk you through creating and launching your first PMax
campaign!

How to Create Quality Display Ads
For Performance Max you need to feed in some assets, so here's a quick lesson on
creating display ads.

Most people reflexively ignore display ads, a phenomenon known as banner blindness.
So display ads must be visually compelling to intrigue users, regardless of whether or
not they actually click on it.

Let’s take a look at a few examples and their strengths and weaknesses.

Example: The New Yorker
Here’s one from The New Yorker.

The good

● The banner’s unique peach background makes it stand out from the page’s other
content.
● It features a high-contrast CTA button—black against peach, with letters in all
caps.
● The illustration matches The New Yorker’s style and branding, and the logo is
clearly included.
The bad

● There’s more text than necessary, like the line “For people who like to read.”
Even if The New Yorker wasn’t well-known, the illustration (two monocled people
holding a book and smartphone) is enough to tell users it’s some kind of a
publication.
○ To avoid clutter, the ad could have read:
Get 12 weeks for $12 $6
Free tote included. Cancel anytime.
Example: Semrush
Now check out this ad from Semrush.

The good

● The text is simple and straightforward. It’s also big and uses bolding to
emphasize “in Minutes,” with no other text distracting from it.
● It uses rich media, which includes video, audio, or any other clickable elements
that make an ad more engaging. In this case, the animated illustration makes the
ad more eye-catching than a static image, and it helps visualize what Semrush is
offering (a website scan).
The bad

● This ad appeared on a white page, so it could have stood out more if it had a
different colored background.
○ Most websites feature dark text on a white background. Ads with bright,
contrasting colors grab attention because they create a visual pattern
interruption.
Example: Casper
If you have a limited time offer, you can also promote it in your display ad, like Casper
does here.

The good

● The ad features many important details, like when the deal ends and how
Casper’s mattresses were called the best by U.S. News.
The bad

● Between the award, promo details, and the tiny exclusion text at the bottom,
there’s a lot going on in this ad. To make it feel less cluttered, you could remove
the copy “Save on award-winning mattresses”—then the award could be
magnified for more legibility.
Example: StoreYa
Finally, one more example—this time, a responsive display ad.

There are a few areas of improvement:

● Part of the description repeats the headline—the “33% off” line. You should avoid
using the same text for your headline and description copy so that your
messaging isn’t redundant. Use that space instead to communicate another
selling point.
● The image doesn’t clearly show what the business does. At first glance, you
might think it’s a bridal shop rather than an ecommerce tool. The image copy
helps here, but viewers still need to connect the dots.
● The ad text has a grammatical error (“Happy Merchant’s” instead of “Happy
Merchants”). Though small, mistakes like this can turn away eagle-eyed
customers.
How to Create Great Video Ads
Instead of shouting at people to buy your product, consider framing your ad as a
narrative. Stories are a lot more memorable than listing or describing product features
because they tap into emotion.

For a better narrative, structure your ad like a three-act play—the three-part structure
takes viewers on a journey to understanding your product.

There are many approaches to how to actually do this, but these are our two favorite
frameworks:

Pain-dream-fix Problem-agitate-solve
1.
Identify your customer’s
pain —their problem and its
consequences.
Describe the dream , what reality
might look like without this
problem.
Explain the fix. Rather than
listing your product’s features,
describe how the product
removes their pain and fulfills the
dream.
1.
Identify your user’s problem.
Agitate users by diving into what
happens if their problem is left
unsolved. Emphasize its side
effects and make users feel more
urgent about fixing it.
Explain how your product solves
the problem.
Besides using a three-part structure, your videos also need to provide value right away
to engage viewers, especially skippable ads. Otherwise, your ad will be skipped—or
worse, it’ll annoy potential customers. They might even avoid buying from your
company because your ads have left a terrible impression.

One final tip for creating good ads: Create videos for YouTube.

We’ve seen many companies repurpose their Facebook video ads on YouTube—and
see poor results. Avoid this. People browse social media and YouTube with different
expectations, so instead of recycling other platforms’ ads, make ones specifically for
YouTube.

Let’s take a look at a few different video ads to see what works and what doesn’t.

Example: Grammarly
First, here’s an ad from Grammarly that follows the pain-dream-fix format.

The video tells the story of Tyler, an employee struggling to communicate with his boss
(the pain). But building a better work relationship (the dream) is possible using
Grammarly (the fix), which is shown throughout the ad. By the end of the video, Tyler
has realized his dream and viewers understand what Grammarly can do for them.

What makes this ad work?

● It tells a relatable story—anyone who’s struggled to connect with their boss
understands the problem. This lets Grammarly show the value of its software in a
way that resonates emotionally (versus simply listing product features).
● A narrator guides the story along at a quick pace.
○ Unlike video ads on other channels, YouTube ads have sound on by
default. For narratives that aren’t so intuitive, we’ve seen that ads with
voiceover perform better than those without.
Example: Pillow Cube
Now check out this ad from Pillow Cube—it uses the problem-agitate-solve framework.

After identifying traditional pillows as the problem, Pillow Cube expands on how they fail
people who sleep on their side. The video agitates viewers by pointing out that
traditional pillows cause people to bend their necks and twist their spines out of
alignment. Then Pillow Cube introduces its pillows, explaining how their cube shape
offers better support.

A few takeaways from this video:

● It tackles the problem (traditional pillows) in the first few seconds.
○ No matter what type of video ad you use, you should get to the problem
immediately, within the first 3-4 seconds. This grabs the viewer’s attention.
● Pillow Cube doesn’t dive into great detail about the materials its pillows are made
of or any other product features. It focuses on their real-life use cases and how
their pillows fit into the viewer’s life.
● It ends with a CTA—we see Pillow Cube’s logo and signs asking viewers to
"Donate" and "Support Our Cause." (This video was originally used for Pillow
Cube's Kickstarter campaign.)
Project: Build your PMax campaign
Overview

It’s time to build and launch your first PMax campaign.

This project guides you through creating a PMax campaign to complement your Search
efforts, integrating Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, and Discover ads for conversions,
brand awareness, and remarketing.

This project guides you through creating and launching your first PMax campaign to
drive growth for your startup using the full power of Google's algorithm.

You’ll build a campaign, configure asset groups, and monitor early performance to
ensure stability before optimizing and scaling.

What you’ll do

● Create a PMax campaign in Google Ads, leveraging Google’s automation for
cross-channel performance.
● Configure campaign settings, asset groups, and targeting signals.
● Launch the campaign and monitor early performance to ensure stability.
● Prepare for optimization and scaling in the next lesson.
Phase 1: Prepare your PMax campaign

Before building, gather the assets and define your goals to set up PMax for success:

● Gather assets (the more the better)
○ Collect at least 3–5 high-quality images (e.g., 1200x1200, 300x250
PNG/JPEG, 150 DPI) showcasing your product or service (see the Ad
Creative module for more guidance),
○ 5 headlines (30 characters each, e.g., “Eco-Friendly Landscaping,” “Book
Now”),
○ 3 long headlines (90 characters each),
○ 5 descriptions (90 characters each, e.g., “Trusted Local Service, Free
Quotes”), and
○ An optional 15–30 second video (MP4, 1280x720) for YouTube
engagement.
● Identify goals : Define your PMax goal (e.g., Target CPA $50, Target ROAS
300%) based on your product and how much you can afford.
Phase 2: Create your PMax campaign

Follow these steps to build a PMax campaign, leveraging Google’s automation and
simplicity:

1. Set up the campaign in Google Ads

● Navigate to campaigns :
○ In Google Ads, click + New Campaign , select Performance Max , and
choose your goal (e.g., “Conversions” with Target CPA $50 or Target
ROAS 300%).
○ Do Target CPA if your conversion doesn't have revenue attached (sign ups
or leads). Do Target ROAS if your conversion has revenue (purchases).
● Configure campaign settings :
○ Budget : Set a daily budget of around $20–$50 to start to test PMax
efficiently on a limited budget.
○ Locations : Use “Presence: People in or regularly in your targeted
locations” (e.g., U.S., UK, or specific states like California) to focus on
residents, reducing irrelevant traffic.
○ Languages : Target “All languages” or English for high-fluency regions
(e.g., U.S., UK), ensuring broad reach.
○ Ad schedule : Leave open initially—PMax optimizes times dynamically,
but you can refine later based on performance data (e.g., weekdays for
B2B products).
2. Create asset groups

PMax replaces ad groups with asset groups , combining assets, targeting signals, and
search themes.

Create 1–2 asset groups to test PMax’s cross-channel performance:

● Asset group 1: High-intent conversions
○ Assets : Upload 3–5 images (e.g., landscaping projects), 5 headlines (e.g.,
“Local Landscaping Experts,” “Book a Quote”), 5 descriptions (e.g., “Free
Estimates, Fast Service”), and an optional video (e.g., 15-second
landscaping demo).
○ Search themes : Add 10–15 keywords related to your business (e.g.,
“landscaping services,” “landscaper near me,” “lawn care solutions”),
letting Google capture intent dynamically.
○ Audience signals : Include in-market audiences (e.g., “Home & Garden”)
and remarketing lists (e.g., website visitors, cart abandoners) to target
users likely to convert.
○ Focus : Drive conversions and remarketing across Search, Display, and
YouTube.
● Asset group 2: Problem-solution searches
○ Assets : Adjust the images, headlines, descriptions, and video to
emphasize solutions to common pain points (e.g., images of fixing patchy
lawns, headlines like “Fix Your Patchy Lawn,” “Solve Lawn Care Issues,”
descriptions like “Expert Solutions for Green Yards, Fast Fixes”). Include
an optional video (e.g., 15-second tutorial on lawn restoration).
○ Search themes : Add 10–15 keywords for problem-solving queries (e.g.,
“fix patchy lawn,” “solve lawn care problems,” “improve garden health,”
“easy landscaping solutions”).
○ Audience signals : Include in-market audiences (e.g., “Home & Garden”)
and affinity audiences (e.g., “Home Improvement Enthusiasts”) seeking
solutions, plus remarketing lists (e.g., users who visited problem-related
pages) for targeted reach on Display and YouTube.
○ Focus : Address users’ specific challenges (e.g., “how to fix a patchy
lawn,” “best solution for lawn maintenance”), driving engagement and
conversions on Display and YouTube by offering problem-solving content.
Tip : Start with 1–2 asset groups to test PMax’s performance—Google’s machine
learning optimizes across asset groups and campaigns so you don't want too many
variables for your small test budget.

3. Set targeting signals

● Choose some high-intent segments to target. For example, for our ads agency
we might choose "Digital Marketing Services" and "Advertising & Marketing
Services) as in-market intent audiences
● Include demographics (e.g., 25–54-year-olds, all genders, 11–50% household
income) and locations (e.g., U.S., UK) to align with your business’s target market,
letting PMax refine dynamically.
Phase 3: Launch your PMax campaign

● Activate the campaign :
○ Review all settings, assets, and targeting signals for errors (e.g.,
disapproved images, missing descriptions).
○ Set the campaign status to Enabled in Google Ads.
○ Verify your budget ($20–$50/day) and ensure no technical issues (e.g.,
tracking errors, disapproved assets).
● Monitor initial performance :
○ Check the campaign daily for the first week to ensure ads serve, budgets
align (e.g., $20–$50/day not overspent), and no technical issues arise
(e.g., tracking errors, disapproved assets).
○ Use columns like impressions, clicks, CTR, conversions, Cost Per
Conversion, and Conversion Value/Cost to monitor early results across
channels (Search, Display, YouTube).
● Avoid over-optimizing : Resist making changes in the first 7–14 days—Google
needs time to learn and optimize.
Great, now we'll learn how to optimize and scale

Project: Optimize & scale your PMax campaign
Overview

Now that you’ve launched your Performance Max (PMax) campaign, it’s time to optimize
performance and scale for growth.

This project guides you through the rather simple process of evaluating PMax’s
cross-channel performance, refining assets, targeting, and budgets, and scaling
strategically to maximize ROI on your startup’s limited budget.

Just be warned, by giving up a lot of power to Google, that also means there's not
nearly as much to optimize for PMax as most of it is done by the algorithm itself.

Let's dive in

What you’ll do

● Evaluate PMax performance using key metrics and reports across channels
(Search, Display, YouTube)
● Optimize assets, targeting signals, and budgets to improve CPA, ROAS, and
conversions.
● Scale your PMax campaign incrementally, increasing budgets and expanding
reach while maintaining profitability.
Phase 1: Evaluate PMax performance (30–60 days after launch)

After launching your PMax campaign, wait 30–60 days (or until you achieve 50+
conversions) for Google’s machine learning to stabilize. Then, assess performance
using data-driven insights:

1. Configure your columns for insights

● In Google Ads, go to your campaigns and click Columns to include:
○ Impressions : How often ads appear across channels.
○ Clicks : User interactions with ads.
○ CTR (Click-Through Rate) : Engagement rate
(clicks/impressions)—higher is better, especially for Display and YouTube.
○ Conversions : Number of completed actions (e.g., sign-ups, purchases).
○ Cost : Total spend across channels.
○ Cost/Conv. (CPA) : Cost per conversion—aim for ≤$50 if targeting
non-revenue conversions (e.g., leads).
○ Conv. Value/Cost (ROAS) : Return on ad spend—aim for ≥300% if
targeting revenue-based conversions (e.g., purchases).
○ Conversion Rate : Percentage of clicks leading to conversions.
● Analyze the performance of the PMax campaign relative to your Search to see if
it's meeting your expectations or not.
○ If it's performing very poorly compared to your Search campaigns, keep a
close eye on it and be prepared to pause it if you're burning money. You
can always try again when you have more conversion history in the
account.
○ If it's close or already profitable, amazing, let's optimize
2. Use the Asset Groups breakdown

● Navigate to your PMax campaign > Asset Groups to see all your Asset Groups
at a high level
● Then click View details on one of the asset groups to see the performance of the
assets
● Unfortunately the metrics you can see are more limited. Namely, you can't see
the Cost associated to each asset, you can only see the the Conversions,
Conversion Value, and "Performance" metrics.
● How to analyze:
○ Sort by Asset Type so you see them grouped together
○ Identify the top assets: High conversions and conversion value, marked as
Best or Good in Performance metric
■ Create variations of these winners
○ Identify the worst assets: Little to no conversions, marked as Low.
■ Remove these asset types ideally
3. Explore the Insights tab

This tab isn't super helpful tbh but it's the only place you get any insight into your
targeting for PMax, so let's dive in:

● Go to your PMax campaign > Insights and reports > Insights tab
● Check out the Audience Insight to see which audience types are getting the
majority of clicks
○ Note you can't see conversion performance but you can likely infer that by
which ones are getting more of the clicks
○ Use this information to decide which audience segments to put more focus
on

● Use Asset Insights to see the overlap of your assets and audiences to see if you
can create specific Asset Groups for those segments using similar messaging
Use Insights to understand overall campaign health, but rely on Asset Groups for
granular optimization, as channel-specific breakdowns aren’t directly segmentable.

4. Explore Devices and Locations

We generally believe in letting Google do its thing, especially with Performance Max,
but if there's emerging winners and losers for Devices and Location we should probably
listen when your budget is limited.

● Go to your PMax campaign > Insights and reports > When and where ads
showed tab
● Analyze Devices:
○ Are there devices that are significantly under or overperforming? If
underperforming, check your funnel on that device to see why that
might be the case.
○ If there's no technical or usability issues, you might want to reduce
bids or exclude (-100% bid adjustment) that device, or prioritize other
ones
○ For example this account shows very expensive Tablet conversions
(hence why the impressions are likely low), and that Mobile devices
are ~50% more expensive than Computers. So it would be worth
checking the usability of their site/funnel/app on Mobile and Tablet.
● Analyze Matched Locations:
○ Are there locations that significantly under or overperform?
○ If so, can we either remove or give priority to ones?
○ For example, this same account appears to get a lot of conversions
from India and Pakistan, but at CPAs that are 50-100% higher than
other countries. It might be worth excluding India and Pakistan if that

CPA exceeds their target
Phase 3: Scale your PMax campaign

After optimizing and confirming profitability (e.g., 60+ days, CPA ≤$50, ROAS ≥300%),
scale PMax strategically to drive growth:

1. Increase budget incrementally

● Rule : Increase your daily budget by 20–50% every 14–30 days, depending on
performance, using Asset Groups and Insights to monitor.
○ Example: If your initial PMax budget is $1,000/month ($33/day), scale to
$1,200–$1,500/month ($40–$50/day) after 30 days of profitability,
checking Asset Groups and Insights for CPA and ROAS.
● Cap at sustainable levels : Limit total monthly spend to 2–3x your initial budget
($2,000–$4,500/month from $1,500) until you confirm long-term profitability (90+
days of consistent ROAS ≥300%, CPA ≤$50), verified by Asset Groups and
Insights.
● Pause if unprofitable : If CPA exceeds your target by >20% (e.g., >$60 for $50)
or ROAS drops >20% (e.g., <240% for 300%) after scaling, pause the increase,
optimize (e.g., refine asset groups, add negative keywords), and reassess after
30 days using Asset Groups and Insights.
2. Expand targeting

● Locations : Add new high-potential markets (e.g., Texas, UK) after proving
profitability in key areas (e.g., California, US).
● Audiences : Expand to similar or affinity audiences (e.g., “Home Improvement
Enthusiasts” for landscaping) after proving success with in-market or remarketing
lists. Use “Observation” mode, then switch to “Targeting” if performance holds,
verified by Asset Groups and Insights.
● Devices : Scale mobile if Insights show it outperforms desktops (common for
local searches)—let Smart Bidding optimize, but increase focus if one device
drives conversions at lower CPA.
3. Expand assets

● Add more assets to existing groups based on winners : Upload additional
images (e.g., 5–10 total), new headlines/descriptions, or longer videos (e.g.,
30-second tutorials) to test engagement on Display and YouTube, monitoring
changes in Asset Groups.
● Add more asset groups with specific focuses.
● Tweak and create new landing pages to see if you can increase
performance off Google.
That's it really
Performance Max is mostly feeding assets into Google and letting the machine figure it
out.

The more conversion data your account has, the better the machine will do.

Introduction
Questions answered in this module
● What do Meta Ads work best for?
● Should my company use Meta Ads?
● What are the best practices for setting up ads on Meta?
● How do I optimize Meta Ads?
Overview
Meta Ads (covering both Facebook and Instagram) enable startups to reach users
across two of the world’s largest social platforms, with over 3 billion monthly active
users combined.

The average user (which is nearly everyone at this point) spends significant time daily
on these platforms, making them ideal for driving conversions efficiently.

Meta’s AI-driven Advantage+ system uses advanced machine learning to deliver highly
relevant ads to users at every stage of the marketing funnel—from awareness to
conversion. This makes Meta Ads a powerful channel for startups testing growth
strategies on limited budgets.

In this unit, we’ll focus on using Meta Ads to drive conversions, grouping Facebook and
Instagram together since they’re managed through the same platform (Meta Ads
Manager).

Specifically, we’ll teach you how to:

● Determine if Meta Ads are a sustainable growth channel for your startup.
● Set up a Meta Business Manager and Ads Manager account, along with an ad
campaign.
● Create high-converting ads optimized for Facebook and Instagram.
● Measure and optimize ad performance to ensure user engagement and
conversions.
What are Meta ads best for?
Meta Ads on Facebook and Instagram are often misunderstood as being only for B2C
or e-commerce businesses, but they’re effective for all types of companies—B2C, B2B,
SaaS, and more.

Take a look at these ads from three successful companies in very different industries:
the meal delivery service Daily Harvest, consumer meditation app Headspace, and real
estate listings website Realtor.com.

Meta ads excel at creating demand rather than capturing it (Google Search Ads
excel at capturing it), making them ideal for:

● Highly innovative products with broad appeal : Products users don’t typically
search for due to their uniqueness benefit from Meta’s visual storytelling. For
example, a startup like Ritual (a multivitamin with suspension oil and transparent
capsules) can highlight its innovation visually, even if users don’t search for such
specific features.
● Alternative solutions to existing problems : Meta Ads introduce users to new
ways of solving problems they might not search for. For instance, Design Pickle
(a subscription-based graphic design service) can target businesses unaware of
this alternative to traditional in-house or freelance designers.
● Awareness and consideration stages : While Meta Ads can drive conversions,
they’re particularly strong for low-intent users browsing social feeds, building
brand awareness and encouraging consideration before conversion.
● Remarketing : Meta Ads are highly effective for retargeting website visitors, app
users, or past customers, driving them back to convert with tailored visuals and
offers.
For startups, Meta Ads often deliver lower customer acquisition costs (CACs) than other
channels, sometimes as low as $5–$10 per conversion, due to their visual format,
precise targeting, and AI optimization.

They complement Google Ads (e.g., Search, Shopping) by creating demand, while
Google Search Ads are more for capturing existing demand.

Ad creative (the image/video) has the most leverage on Meta.

How Meta ads work
Meta Ads leverage Facebook and Instagram’s shared ecosystem, managed through
Meta Ads Manager, with AI-driven Advantage+ campaigns optimizing performance
across platforms.

Here’s how they work these days:

● Advantage+ AI optimization : Meta’s Advantage+ system uses AI to analyze
user behavior, interests, and intent, delivering ads to the most relevant audiences
at the right time. It tests variables like platform (Facebook vs. Instagram),
placement (Feed, Stories, Reels), and creative formats, optimizing for your goal
(e.g., conversions, traffic).
● Cross-platform delivery : Meta Ads automatically distribute across Facebook
and Instagram, including placements like News Feed, Stories, Reels, Explore,
and Marketplace, based on where users are most likely to engage. You don’t
need to choose platforms manually—Advantage+ AI decides for you.
● Visual-first format : Meta Ads prioritize visuals (images, videos, carousels) over
text, taking up significant screen real estate, allowing you to visually tell your
story. This makes them ideal for showcasing products or services emotionally
and visually.
● Campaign objectives : Meta Ads support various goals (e.g., Awareness, Traffic,
Engagement, Leads, Sales), but we’ll focus on Sales (conversions) for startups
aiming to drive purchases or sign-ups.
● Automation focus : Unlike manual optimization, Advantage+ campaigns
(recommended for startups) handle targeting, bidding , and placement, requiring
only a budget, creative assets, and a goal.
Manual targeting is still available and can be great to use in specific circumstances to
test new ad creatives, but it's less efficient overall.

Facebook vs. Instagram

You might think that you should choose between advertising on one or the other, but at
this point you should let Meta's AI decide when and where to show your ads.

Advantage+ campaigns test both platforms in the first 7–14 days, optimizing for your
goal (e.g., Sales). After this learning phase, Meta prioritizes the platform driving better
results (e.g., Instagram for a visually driven landscaping ad, Facebook for a B2B SaaS
lead form).

Tip : Don’t preselect a platform—let Advantage+ AI determine the best placement for
your ads. Focus on creating versatile ad creatives (e.g., 1:1 for both platforms, 4:5 for
Stories/Reels) to ensure compatibility across Facebook and Instagram.

Quick tips for startups

● Start with Advantage+ campaigns : Launch an Advantage+ Sales campaign
(e.g., $500–$1,500/month) to test conversions across Facebook and Instagram,
letting Meta’s AI optimize targeting, placement, and bidding.
● Focus on ad creatives : Prioritize high-quality visuals (images, videos,
carousels) over targeting—Meta’s AI handles audience selection, but compelling
creatives drive engagement and conversions.
● Leverage automation : Use Advantage+ audience selection and Lowest Cost
bidding to maximize conversions within your budget, avoiding manual targeting
unless refining remarketing.
● Test with small budgets : Allocate $1,500–$3,000/month initially, monitor CPA
and ROAS for 14–30 days, then scale to $3,000–$5,000/month if profitable.
● Combine with Google Search Ads : Use Meta Ads to create demand
(awareness, consideration), complementing Google Search/Shopping Ads for
capturing high-intent users, lowering overall CAC.
Okay let's dive deeper into Meta Ads!

Mark Incomplete

Meta Ad Types
Meta Ads lets you run ads on both Facebook and Instagram.

This lesson explores:

● The structure of Meta Ads (campaigns, ad sets, ads),
● Key ad formats and placements
We’ll focus on modern formats and best practices, leveraging Meta’s Advantage+ AI for
automation and optimization across platforms.Meta ads structure

Meta ads structure
Meta Ads are organized in three levels: the campaign, ad sets, and ads.

● Campaign : The top level, where you set your objective (e.g., Sales, Traffic,
Engagement). We recommend the Sales objective (conversions) to focus on
traceable actions tied to revenue (e.g., purchases, sign-ups). Advantage+ Sales
campaigns automate most settings, making them ideal for beginners.
● Ad set : Groups of ads under a campaign, where you define your audience,
budget, schedule, and placements. In Advantage+ campaigns, Meta’s AI handles
audience targeting and placement, but you can refine with custom audiences or
remarketing if needed after testing.
○ Note in Google Search you define budgets and targeting at the Campaign
level, in Meta Ads nearly all of that is defined at the Ad Set level.
● Ad : The individual creatives (images, videos, copy, CTAs) that users see, linked
to a landing page or in-platform action (e.g., lead form). Ads within the same ad
set should align with the same goal (e.g., driving e-commerce sales for
landscaping equipment).
Understanding these levels is key, as we’ll use them throughout this module. Ad formats
and placements vary, but Meta’s AI simplifies testing by optimizing across options.

Ad formats

Meta Ads support various formats, with visuals (images, videos) being the star of the
show.

Here are the most effective formats:

NOTE: We go into way more detail into how to create great ads in the Ad Creative
module!

Video ads

● Overview : Video ads are harder to make but often outperform static
images—especially for their storytelling power and dynamism.
● Best for : Startups with visually engaging products or services. Some studies
show that video ads work best for "hedonistic" or pleasure based products,
whereas for more utilitarian products they have less of an impact.
● Examples of types of videos include:
○ Customer testimonials : Users sharing how your product solved their
problem
○ Transformation videos : Before-and-after visualizations.
○ Product demos : Short walkthroughs with captions or voiceovers (e.g.,
showing a SaaS tool’s UI).
○ UGC-like videos: Where it looks like someone is talking about how much
they love the product.
○ Hype video: Rapid cut video featuring your product.
○ Motion ads: A static creative that comes to life with some motion.
● Best practices :
○ The first 3 seconds are the most important.
○ Keep videos 15–30 seconds long to retain attention, per Meta’s 2025
recommendations.
○ Use captions (85% of users watch without sound) and a compelling
thumbnail.
○ Optimize for mobile (4:5 or 1:1 aspect ratio for Feed, 9:16 for
Stories/Reels).
● When to avoid : Honestly, with the power of smartphones and AI, basically
everyone can create video ads these days. You can easily film UGC-style videos
using a smartphone + Capcut, or do AI generated ads using Icon.
Image ads

● Overview : Single-image ads are simple to create and can still be very effective.
● Best for : Startups with limited creative resources or products that don’t require
dynamic storytelling.
● Best practices :
○ Use high-res images (e.g., 1080x1080 or 1200x628, 150 DPI)
○ Experiment a ton with messaging, imagery, format, and more.
○ Highlight a single benefit
○ Optimize for 1:1 (Feed) or 4:5 (Stories) aspect ratios to ensure
compatibility
Carousel ads

● Overview : Carousel ads display 3–10 images or videos in a swipeable format,
ideal for showcasing multiple products or features in one ad.
● Best for : E-commerce startups with diverse products (e.g., landscaping tools,
garden decor) or to highlight features of a single product (e.g., a lawn mower’s
speed, battery life, eco-design).
● Best practices :
○ Use 3–5 images/videos for optimal engagement—too many (e.g., 10)
reduce completion rates.
○ Start with a compelling first imagea nd keep headlines concise
○ Use a consistent visual theme (e.g., same color scheme, branding) across
cards to maintain flow.
○ Optimize for 1:1 aspect ratio for compatibility across Feed placements.
○ Use the linear format to tell a story or highlight different value props.
Lead ads

Source: https://www.driftrock.com/facebook-lead-ads-guide
● Overview : Lead ads use in-platform forms (e.g., on Facebook/Instagram) to
capture user information without redirecting to a landing page, reducing friction
for lead generation.
● Best for : Startups with high lifetime value (LTV) products/services (e.g., >$500
LTV) like B2B SaaS or services, where collecting leads and contacting them via
sales is normal.
● Creatives are the same: Lead ads are just like static ads, it's just instead of a
click going to a landing page, it goes to a form directly in Facebook or Instagram.
● Best practices :
○ Use specific ad copy to attract the right audience (e.g., “Landscaping
Pros: Get a Free Quote!” to target business owners, not DIY users).
○ Keep forms short (3–5 fields, e.g., name, email, phone) to boost
completion rates.
○ Pair with remarketing to convert leads who don’t act immediately.
● Caution : Lead ads may generate lower-quality leads—use specific creatives and
forms to filter for high-intent users.
Modern tip : Start with Video or Image ads for simplicity, testing Carousel or Lead ads
after 30 days of data. Use Reels ads if targeting Instagram’s mobile-first audience with
short, engaging content.

Placements

Meta Ads appear across various placements on Facebook and Instagram, with
Advantage+ AI optimizing delivery. In 2025, the focus is on high-engagement
placements, and Meta recommends Automatic Placements for startups.

Here are the key placements:

● News Feed (Facebook and Instagram) : Ads appear in users’ main feeds,
blending with organic content. Best for Image, Video, and Carousel ads, driving
high visibility and engagement.
● Stories (Facebook and Instagram) : Full-screen vertical ads (9:16) shown
between users’ Stories, acting as a “commercial break.” Ideal for Video or Image
ads, capturing immediate attention with interactive elements (e.g., polls, swipe-up
CTAs).
● Reels (Instagram) : Short-form video ads within Reels, highly engaging for
mobile-first audiences. Best for vertical Video ads (9:16), leveraging trending
audio or effects.
● Explore (Instagram) : Ads in the Explore tab, reaching users discovering new
content. Suits Image or Video ads targeting broad interests.
● Marketplace (Facebook) : Ads in the Marketplace tab, ideal for ecomm startups
targeting users browsing products.
Automatic Placements recommendation : Let Advantage+ AI select placements by
enabling Automatic Placements in your campaign setup. Meta’s AI tests all options
(Feed, Stories, Reels, etc.) in the first 14–30 days, prioritizing high-performing
placements (e.g., Instagram Stories for a landscaping ad). Manual placements limit
reach and efficiency—avoid them unless refining after 30+ days of data.

Meta Ads Targeting
What you’ll learn

● How Meta Ads targeting works with Advantage+ AI and manual options.
● Detailed manual targeting options for Facebook and Instagram ads.
● Best practices for setting up targeting to maximize conversions.
● Why Advantage+ is recommended, with an advanced strategy for manual testing.
Introduction
Google Search Ads get triggered based on an action someone takes.

Namely, searching for a particular search term, which signals intent.

Meta Ads get triggered based purely on what Meta knows about you and what you're
likely to be interested in and considering buying. This is based on your behavior both on
Facebook/Instagram and on sites that have the Meta ad pixel installed.

You can either target manually or by getting Meta to 100% handle it for you.

This lesson explores both approaches, ultimately recommending Advantage+ for
startups with limited budgets (< $10K/month), while offering an advanced manual
strategy to test creatives. We’ll focus on targeting for an ecomm startup selling fitness
gear, ensuring you can apply these principles to your business.

A quick example:

Based on the content someone views or interacts with both on and off Facebook, the
algorithm might determine that they’re interested in environmentalism, dogs, and silly
humor. So Facebook shows them dog videos, animal comics, and ads for reforestation
nonprofits.

Facebook tailors its content—both paid and organic—to users' preferences so that they stay on its
site and app for longer.
How Meta ads targeting works

As mentioned, two main approaches exist, and oddly they're also kind of mixed:

● Manual targeting : You define specific audiences using detailed filters (e.g.,
demographics, interests, behaviors), offering control for testing hypotheses or
refining underperforming campaigns. Manual targeting is less efficient overall but
valuable for advanced creative testing.
● Advantage+ AI targeting : Meta’s Advantage+ system uses machine learning to
analyze billions of data points, automatically selecting audiences based on your
campaign objective (e.g., Sales). Confusingly, when you do Advantage+, you
can also choose specific Demographics, Audiences, Interests, Behaviors,
etc, but just do the Advantage+ option, which will be more liberal and
experimental with its targeting outside that core set when it feels that it will
perform better to do so.
For startups, Advantage+ targeting is the default recommendation due to its efficiency
and scalability, but learning manual options ensures you understand the full toolkit—and
it's useful for advanced strategies.

Manual targeting options

Manual targeting lets you refine down to the specific audience characteristics you think
is most likely to convert. The success of this heavily depends on whether you're right
about those specific chatacteristics.

Here are the key options to explore, using a fitness gear startup as an example:

1. Demographics

Facebook makes it easy to target using basic demographic criteria.

● Age : Set a range (e.g., 18–45 for fitness gear targeting active adults).
● Gender : Include “All,” “Men,” or “Women” based on your product (e.g., unisex
fitness gear).
● Location : Target “People living in” specific regions (e.g., U.S., California) or
exclude areas (e.g., rural zones with low demand).
● Language : Match your audience’s language (e.g., English for U.S.-based users).
● Best practice : Exclude the obvious demographics that cannot or will not buy
your product. But leave the rest for Meta to determine which is best.
2. Interests

Facebook offers a wide variety of interest targeting options.

● Categories : Here, you target users interested in related topics (e.g., “Fitness,”
“Health & Wellness,” “Gym Equipment” for fitness gear). These are predefined by
Meta.
● Detailed targeting : Add specific interests (e.g., “Yoga,” “Running,” “Home
Workouts”) to reach niche segments.
● Comparison to Google : Interests are similar to Google’s affinity audiences (e.g.,
“Health & Wellness Enthusiasts”), but Meta’s data comes from user interactions
on Facebook/Instagram (e.g., liking fitness pages) rather than search or browsing
behavior.
● Best practice : Use 3–5 interests initially, avoiding overlap (e.g., “Fitness” and
“Gym” might duplicate), and refine based on engagement after 14 days.
3. Behaviors

Facebook's behavior targeting options include general traits like device type and travel,
plus niche behaviors like soccer-watching habits.

These are pre-defined audiences

● Overview : Behaviors target users based on actions they’ve taken on Meta’s
platforms, similar to Google’s predefined audiences (e.g., in-market or affinity),
but focused on social engagement rather than search intent.
● Categories :
○ Purchase behavior : Target users with habits like “Frequent Shoppers” or
“E-commerce Shoppers” (akin to Google’s in-market “Online Shoppers”).
○ Engagement behavior : Reach users who engage with content (e.g.,
“Video Views: 25%+ Completed,” similar to Google’s YouTube
engagement audiences).
○ Device usage : Target based on device (e.g., “Mobile Device Users”).
● Comparison to Google : While Google’s in-market audiences (e.g., “Fitness
Products”) focus on search intent (e.g., users researching fitness gear), Meta’s
Behaviors emphasize actions on-platform (e.g., buying fitness products via
Marketplace, watching fitness videos).
● Best practice : Combine with interests (e.g., “Frequent Shoppers” + “Fitness”) to
boost intent, monitoring CPA after 30 days.
4. Custom audiences

When setting your targeting options, you can either create a new Custom Audience or
choose a saved one from your existing list.

To create a Custom Audience, you can upload your own customer data (Your Sources)
or pull data from Meta. If you upload your data, Meta matches it with real Facebook
profiles to find your audience.

● Website visitors : Upload a pixel-tracked list of users who visited your site (e.g.,
fitness gear product pages) for remarketing.
● Customer list : Upload a CSV of existing customers (e.g., email addresses) to
target or exclude.
● Engagement : Target users who interacted with your page, video, or lead form.
● Best practice : Start with a 30-day website visitor list (minimum 100 users) and
test a 1% lookalike audience (see below) for scale.
5. Lookalike audiences

Choosing a higher percentage, like 5 or 10%, means you'll reach a wider audience with
a tradeoff in audience similarity.

● Overview: Here, you get Meta to create a list of people who "look like" people in
a source audience (like your top 500 customers)
● Similarity : For lookalikes you choose a percentile of similarity between 1% and
10%. 1% means it's the top 1% of people who are similar to your audience (i.e.
the most similar).
● Best practice : Use a high-value customer list (e.g., $100+ LTV buyers) for a 1%
lookalike, expanding to 3% after 30 days of positive ROI.
6. Exclusions

● Exclude custom audiences (e.g., recent converters), locations (e.g.,
low-performing states), or interests (e.g., “Women's clothes” when you sell men's
clothes) to refine reach.
● Best practice : Exclude converters after purchase to avoid overspending, adding
exclusions after 14 days of data.
Tip: Again, we generally recommend automatic targeting, but for advanced creative
testing strategies we will use some manual targeting.

Advantage+ targeting

Advantage+ AI automates targeting, replacing manual efforts with machine learning for
efficiency:

● How it works : Upload your ad creatives and set a goal (e.g., Sales). If you have
a product that is not super broad, it might be a good idea to use an Advantage+
audience.
● Automatic: It uses Meta’s data (interests, behaviors, lookalikes) without specific
input, optimizing dynamically. It will also go outside your specified audiences if it
feels it can achieve better performance.
● Placements : Optimizes across Feed, Stories, Reels, Explore, and Marketplace,
selecting the best options.
● Learning phase : Requires 7–14 days or 50+ conversions for
stabilization—ensure a budget to support this (which depends on the acceptable
CPA)
● Best for : Everyone as it does yield the best results.
Recommendation : Use Advantage+ as your primary strategy for its automation and
cost efficiency. Let Meta’s AI handle targeting, focusing on high-quality creatives (e.g.,
3–5 images, 1–2 videos).

Next we'll quickly introduce a more advanced campaign strategy that uses both
Advantage+ and Manual.

Advanced strategy: Manual targeting campaign for creative testing

Advantage+ can sometimes be overly opinionated with its creative and not give them
enough opportunity to be adequately proven.

For startups with some experience or data (e.g., 50+ conversions), an advanced manual
targeting campaign can test creatives effectively before scaling with Advantage+:

● Setup :
○ Create a separate ad set with a Sales objective.
○ Use manual targeting (e.g., “Fitness” interest, 18–45 age, U.S. location,
“Frequent Shoppers” behavior, website visitors).
○ Upload 3–5 ad variations (e.g., different video hooks, image styles) within
one ad set to compare performance.
● Execution :
○ Allocate at least ~$1,000/month per ad set, monitoring for 14–30 days.
○ Use Lowest Cost bidding to test which creative drives the lowest CPA.
○ Analyze the Breakdowns > By Delivery report to identify top-performing
creatives.
● Outcome :
○ Pause underperforming ads and cycle in new creatives to be tested.
○ If you find winners, pause them as well and move them over to the
Advantage+ campaign to be scaled.
○ Use insights (e.g., video outperforming images) to refine future creatives.
● Best for : Startups with enough budget and data to isolate creative impact,
complementing Advantage+ campaigns for long-term optimization.
Tip : Reserve manual targeting for creative testing after 30 days of Advantage+ data.
Keep it simple (1–2 ad sets) to avoid budget dilution, transitioning to Advantage+ for
scale.

Quick tips

● Start with Advantage+ : Launch an Advantage+ Sales campaign first. Let Meta’s
AI optimize targeting across Facebook and Instagram for conversions.
● Learn manual targeting : Use demographics, interests, behaviors, and
custom/lookalikes to point Advantage+ in the right direction given you're starting
from scratch, but rely on Advantage+ for efficiency unless testing creatives.
● Test creatives manually (advanced) : After 30+ days of Advantage+ data, run a
manual campaign with a smaller budget to test 3–5 ad variations, scaling winners
to Advantage+.
● Monitor learning phase : Allow 14–30 days (50+ conversions) for Advantage+ to
stabilize, ensuring a healthy budget to avoid skewed results.
● Combine with Google Ads : Use Meta Ads for demand creation (awareness,
consideration), complementing Google Search/Shopping Ads for capturing
high-intent users.
Final
notes
Ads are all about experimentation—and that's the most true when it comes to ad
creatives.

You'll always want to do a mix of images, carousels, and video ads to see what
performs best.

Images are the easiest to create and iterate on, and videos have the highest potential
for engagement.

Prospecting and Retargeting Campaigns
What you’ll learn

● How prospecting campaigns target new users to create demand.
● How retargeting campaigns re-engage past visitors to drive conversions using
Advantage+ or manual targeting.
● Targeting strategies for both prospecting and retargeting to maximize ROI on a
limited budget.
● Best practices for structuring campaigns, including an advanced manual strategy
for testing.
Introduction

There are two primary types of campaigns you can run:

Prospecting: You're trying to reach entirely new audiences.
Retargeting : You're trying to re-engage your existing audience.
This lesson will teach you the nuances of each and our recommendations.

We’ll use a fitness gear e-commerce startup as an example, detailing how to target new
users, retarget engaged audiences, and optimize campaigns using Advantage+ AI
(suitable even for beginners like me with limited Meta experience) or manual strategies
for control.

By the end, you’ll know how to structure campaigns to create demand and close
conversions efficiently.

Prospecting campaigns: Targeting new users

Prospecting campaigns focus on reaching new users unfamiliar with your brand,
creating demand and building awareness.

For example for a fitness gear startup, this means targeting potential customers who
have never been to our website before who might be interested in fitness products.

Key variables to consider

When structuring prospecting campaigns, consider:

● Market : Broad products suit wider targeting; niche markets (e.g., yoga gear)
need focus.
● Budget : Larger budgets ($5,000+/month) allow experimentation; smaller budgets
($500–$1,500/month) require focused testing.
Prospecting targeting strategies

Prospecting uses manual targeting (to test hypotheses) and Advantage+ AI (for
automation).

Here are ways to refine your prospecting and we recommend using the Advantage+
targeting options:

● Lookalike audiences :
○ Best for : Companies with quality data (e.g., 1,000+ fitness gear buyers).
○ Setup : Create a 1% lookalike from high-value customers (e.g., $100+
LTV), scaling to 2%–3% if profitable, excluding previous audiences.
○ Challenges : Needs significant data (1,000+ users recommended;
minimum 100). iOS privacy updates have reduced effectiveness, with
CPMs 2–3x higher than broad targeting.
○ Best practice : Update lists monthly (or tap into the Facebook API), testing
alongside other strategies.
● Broad interest targeting :
○ Best for : C
○ Setup : Target a wide audience (e.g., U.S., 18–65), letting AI refine via
creatives testing hypotheses (e.g., ad set 1: “Sustainable Gear”; ad set 2:
“Workout Comfort”).
○ Advantages : Low CPMs, leverages AI to find intent.
○ Best practice : Use 2–3 ad sets with 3–5 creatives each, testing value
props.
● Narrow interest targeting :
○ Best for : Niche products (e.g., yoga gear) or $500–$1,500/month
budgets.
○ Setup : Use specific filters (e.g., “Yoga” interest, 18–45, women), testing
audiences with the same creatives.
○ Best practice : Avoid hyper-targeting, testing broad targeting as a
baseline.
Recommendation for prospecting : Given you have a limited testing budget, you'll
want to refine to the people most likely to purchase your product. So create one ad sets
that target a 1% lookalikes and another that targets niche
behaviours/interests/demographics that accurately describe your ideal customers. Use
the Advantage+ options.

And of course, the advanced strategy of Advantage+ and Manual from the Meta Ads
Targeting lesson still applies :).

Retargeting campaigns: Re-engaging past visitors

Retargeting campaigns target users who’ve interacted with your brand (e.g., visited your
fitness gear site), aiming to drive them back to convert.

These are more cost-effective than prospecting, as users already know your product or
brand.

Key considerations

● Website traffic : Works best with 1,000+ monthly visitors for a viable audience.
● Budget allocation : Start with 80% prospecting and 20% retargeting, adjusting to
70/30 if retargeting CPA is significantly lower after 30 days.
● Ad creatives : Use more targeted and salesy messaging (e.g., “Get X% off”)
distinct from prospecting ads.
Retargeting targeting strategies

Retargeting uses custom audiences with Advantage+ or manual precision:

● Custom audiences with Advantage+ :
○ Setup : Upload pixel-tracked audiences (e.g., 30-day website visitors,
add-to-cart users) in an Advantage+ Sales campaign. Meta’s AI refines
targeting, tests creatives, and optimizes placements (Feed, Stories,
Reels).
○ Execution : Set a goal (e.g., Target Cost $50), allocate $200–$500/month
(20% of budget), and allow a 7–14 day learning phase (50+ conversions).
○ Benefits : Automates delivery to similar high-intent users, reducing manual
effort. Ideal for beginners with limited Meta experience.
○ Best practice : Exclude recent converters to avoid overspending, ensuring
100+ visitor data for accuracy.
● Manual custom audiences :
○ Setup : Create ad sets targeting specific actions (e.g., “Add to Cart” in last
7 days, “Viewed Product” in 30 days) using Meta Pixel data.
○ Execution : Use Lowest Cost bidding, testing 2–3 ad variations per ad set
(e.g., discounts vs. new features).
○ Best practice : Start with a 30-day window (minimum 100 users),
expanding with lookalikes (1% from converters) after 30 days.
Retargeting ad tactics

● New value props : Highlight complementary benefits that your value prop didn't
get into.
● Product-specific ads : Target by category viewed (e.g., yoga gear for yoga mat
viewers).
● Incentives : Offer discounts or perks (e.g., “15% Off Your Fitness Gear Today!”).
● Best practice : Create 2–3 ad variations per retargeting ad set, testing incentives
or new angles.
Recommendation for retargeting : Adding Advantage+ will actually make your
remarketing campaign a little bit like a prospecting campaign, as it will go outside of
your remarketing list. We recommend starting with a pure manual retargeting
campaign so you can actually test it as remarketing.

Final notes

Prospecting and retargeting campaigns on Meta Ads drive growth—prospecting creates
demand, while retargeting converts engaged users who simply failed to convert the first
time.

Start with refined Advantage+ targeting for prospecting. Use custom audiences for
retargeting.

How to Create Quality Meta Ads
Check out the Ad Creative module for a deeper dive.

Your ad creatives are the most important part of your Meta ads strategy. That’s because
they also handle targeting—as in, they help direct Meta's algorithm on who would be
most likely to engage with your ad.

As discussed earlier, you should focus on testing a wide variety of ad creatives to find
out what attracts users.

For Meta specifically, there are four important variables involved in creating good ads:

● Creative: The image or video used for your ad
● Copy: The words in and around the ad
● Audience: The specific group(s) of people you’re targeting
● The rest of the funnel: What happens after users click your ad
Here’s a look at some of these components.

You’ve probably seen some companies that take a more straightforward approach with
their creatives, presenting their products exactly as is in their creatives. Then there are
brands that create out-of-the-box ads, using more abstract imagery.

Which ads perform better? There’s no hard answer. Testing your Meta ads will require
experimentation with all of the elements listed above. And you need to experiment a
lot —don't expect to land on very affordable conversions with your first 5-10 ads.

For starters, we recommend creating ads that are very different from one another.
See which one performs best. Then create more ads that follow the “winning” theme,
and continue to test different variables along the way.

There are ultimately no hard rules for what makes an ad succeed on Meta. Our unit
about Ad Creatives (specifically our lesson about Ad Design Guidelines) goes over
important design principles, but here are several more best practices:

● Communicate a specific value prop. Show users how they’d benefit from your
product or service. Some ideas here: feature happy customer testimonials as
social proof, or show a before and after image of your product’s impact.
● Include a clear CTA. Users should understand what will happen by clicking on
your ad—will they get a free sample or a discount off their total purchase?
○ Note that for Instagram-specific assets, your creative copy is even more
important since the ad text is less prominent (it appears below the creative
instead of above).
● Speak to a specific user persona. Create ads with your target audience in
mind—who they are and what they're looking for. Think of the key questions they
might ask about your product, and then answer them in your ad.
● Create a sense of urgency. Motivate users to act on your ad immediately rather
than giving them the room to second guess. Set a finite date of expiration or use
a phrase like “Today only!”
● Use contrasting design elements. Contrasting colors make your ad more
eye-catching. Your ads should stop users from continuing to scroll through their
newsfeed or Stories.
● Include captions in your video ads. Since Meta ads don’t play with audio by
default, captions help to get your message across silently.
Examples
Let’s look at some Meta ads to see what works and what doesn’t.

Here’s an offer ad from HelloFresh targeting churned customers.

What makes this ad work?

● A bright, colorful summer theme ties the ad together and grabs users’ attention,
with HelloFresh’s product displayed front and center.
● The body copy clearly communicates HelloFresh’s value prop: “less time in the
kitchen, and way more time soaking up the sun.” It also uses emojis and short
bullets in a quick, easy-to-read summary.
● The copy in the creative creates urgency—it’s a flash sale, and the offer is for this
week only.
Now check out these prospecting ads from three different companies advertising some
kind of scheduling software.

All three use a static image but take very different approaches.

● Left: The ad doesn’t visually hook users—there’s no illustration or graphic to pull
users in. Instead, if they do stop to look at this ad, people must read several lines
of text to get an idea of what it’s about. The red contrasting element in the corner
might grab attention, but “New for 2021” doesn’t mean much without other
context.
● Middle: The ad features a relevant calendar illustration that gives users a hint of
what the company does. However, it’s not clear what exactly its main benefit is
unless you read the surrounding ad copy. In this case, copy could be added to
the image to spell out the main value prop and hook readers—ideally a short
headline like “Free up your calendar!” Otherwise, users must stop to read the rest
of the ad.
● Right: This ad is the best of both worlds: the creative shows a large headline
above a relevant visual. The copy is short and simple (unlike the first ad’s), and
the image clearly illustrates what the product does (Instagram scheduling).
Now take a look at this retargeting video from ClickUp using Instagram Stories.

This ad works well because:

● It shows an actual human, who walks through how they use ClickUp. This feels a
lot more relatable and engaging than simply showing screenshots of ClickUp’s
software.
○ A testimonial or quick product demo is especially useful for SaaS
companies or products that need more explanation.
● It uses captions. Since sound doesn’t play by default on Instagram, captions help
get your message across to viewers watching without audio.
○ Watch out for the CTA button at the bottom of Stories. Ideally your
captions are very clear and don’t overlap with this button, as they do in
ClickUp’s ad.
Finally, a few examples of right column ads on Facebook from Superside (top) and
Chargebee (bottom).

● Neither ad creative is 100% clear. Can you tell what company logos are in
Superside’s ad? Or what the text says in Chargebee’s? The small image size
makes them illegible.
○ When including text in your ad, aim for fewer words so that they can be
bigger and work for more ad placements. (Alternatively, create different
versions of your ads for specific placements.)
● For Chargebee’s ad, no URL appears beside the creative—so users have no
way of finding out what company is being advertised (or what you can watch for
free) unless they click on it.
○ A more descriptive headline like “Watch Chargebee's Free Webinar Now”
tells users what they’ll get from clicking, all while fitting within Facebook’s
40-character limit.
Remember that the rest of the funnel, or what happens after someone clicks your ad, is
just as important as the ad creative itself. Avoid simply leading users to your
homepage—direct them instead to a very specific landing page that expands on the ad.
Make it easy for visitors to take whatever next step you want them to.

For example, here’s a prospecting ad from the B2B sales tool Showpad and the page it
leads to.

The ad leads to a landing page designed to educate users about hybrid sales. It’s a lot
more informative than Showpad’s homepage, which features company logos and

customer testimonials—elements that build social proof but don’t fully explain what
Showpad does.

To increase your chance of getting conversions, send users to landing pages that build
on the ads you’re serving, not your general homepage.

Meta Ads Account Setup
There are two important pieces to advertising on Facebook and Instagram:

Business Manager account: Used to manage all of your Facebook marketing
needs, like your Facebook/Instagram pages, ad accounts, and the
employees/contractors working on them.
Meta Ads Manager account: Used to manage and create ad campaigns. This is
housed within Meta's Business Manager, but it's possible to run ads directly in
Ads Manager without having a Business Manager account.
A Business Manager account is especially useful if you run multiple ad accounts and
pages, or have multiple employees who need access to your Meta assets. But even if
these don't apply to you, we recommend creating an account since it's free and has a
lot of data.

To set up a Business Manager account and Meta Ads Manager Account, we generall
recommend using your personal Facebook account as Meta is pretty sensitive about
wanting verifiably real people. We'll cover these processes below—plus, additional
information for creating your ad campaigns.

How to create a Business Manager Account
Go to Meta's Business Manager page: https://business.facebook.com/
Click Create account.
Log into your personal Facebook account if you aren’t already logged in. Or
whichever account you will be using—it doesn't have to be personal, it can be
work.
Fill in your business details, like name and email.
Click Submit. Your Business Manager account will be created, but you’ll also
need to confirm your email.
How to create an Ads Manager account (using
Business Manager)
On your Business Manager homepage, go to Accounts -> Ad accounts in the
On the Ad accounts page, click Add > Create a new ad account in top right
corner.
Type in the details for your Ad Account. Pay attention to the currency field—you
can’t edit this in the future.
Once completed, your Ad Account will be created, and you can add employees
or contractors to it.
Domain verification
Because of Apple's iOS updates, most people also need to verify their domains in
Facebook Business Manager before they can set up and track their website
conversions. You’ll need access to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Dreamhost, etc.) to
do this.

Here’s a quick rundown of the process:

In the Business Manager, click the Brand safety and suitability -> Domains in
the left sidebar
Click the Add dropdown. Click Create a new domain and add your domain URL
without http:// or https://. Then click Add.
Three options for verifying your domain will appear:
Follow the steps and click the Verify button. (Note that verification can take up to
2-3 days.)
Once your domain has been verified, click Connected Assets.
Then click Add Assets. You’ll see the Facebook Pages you manage appear;
select the one that should be associated with your business and click Add.
Ensure your pixel is connected
Here’s how to ensure your pixel is connected and seeing events

In your Facebook Business Manager dashboard, click on the account you want
to work on.
Click Data Sources -> Datasets in left sidebar:
Select your Pixel.
Make sure it's connected to your Ad Account
If not, connect it :)
Then go to the Event Manager
Go to Data Sources
Select your Pixel
Ensure you're seeing events being logged
Spending limit for new accounts
If you’re starting out with a new ads account, you may notice that your full budget isn’t
being spent immediately.

This is normal—Meta places a daily spending limit that will lift on its own after a few
weeks and successful payments!

Budget Optimization
There are two philosophies on how to structure your campaigns with regard to how
Meta distributes your ad spend across campaigns, ad sets, and ads: campaign budget
optimization (CBO) and ad set budget optimization (ABO).

CBO is a platform feature where Meta's AI takes control of how your campaign’s budget
is allocated to its ad sets. You can turn this option on during the campaign creation
process.

But with an ABO strategy, you manually decide how much to allocate to each ad
set—not Facebook. You set this budget at the ad set level.

When and how should each strategy be used?

Campaign budget optimization (CBO)
● Uses Meta's powerful AI, which
generally yields the best results.
● Involves creating fewer
campaigns, with lots of ad sets in
each
Ad set budget optimization (ABO)
● Give you far more control
● Involves creating more campaigns
and fewer ad sets per campaign
Meta's AI is increasingly getting far better at picking than a skilled media buyer. Given
you're also new to media buyer, it's logical to conclude that Meta's AI will likely
significantly outperform you ;)

We recommend using CBO as your default. Only use ABO if you for some reason
want granular control and think you can outperform the AI.

Project: Generate Audiences and Ad
Sets
In this project, you'll draft a document with all of your possible Meta audiences. Then
you'll actually save them into real ad sets in our next project.

A reminder about targeting strategies:

● Broad interest targeting is best for companies selling products with broad
appeal and/or have a large ads budget of at least $5,000/month.
● Narrow(er) interest targeting is best for companies selling niche products, want
to validate their hypotheses on product-market fit, and/or have a small ads
budget (less than $5,000/month).
Note: In general, Meta's AI will do a better job of targeting than you can, so it's
best not to go too narrow or else you're not giving the AI the full ability to find the
right people.

Because this project focuses on exploring Meta's targeting options, it's especially helpful
for companies pursuing narrow interest targeting strategies.

Ad sets
Meta ads are organized into ad sets. Ad sets are different groups, or “sets” of ads that
show to every audience you want to test.

Here's what they look like in the Meta Ads Manager:

Generating audiences
You should have a general idea of who you’d like to target based on our earlier readings
about customer and market research. This project walks through how to find the specific
audiences that you can reach on Facebook and Instagram.

When you come up with different audiences to show your ads to on Meta, you’ll want to
try as many different ones as you could reasonably expect to want your product.

High-level, here are the main ways you can target on Facebook:

● Interest-based targeting : Food, fashion, photography, etc.
● Behavior-based targeting : New moms, frequent flyers, high-end diners, etc.
● Job title or targeting : Software engineers, sales representatives, etc.
● Friends of people who used your app/liked your page
● Custom audiences: static or dynamic lists of your users or customers.
● Lookalike audiences : tailored audiences Meta algorithmically generates for you
based on your list of customers or users
Phase 1: Generate your first audience,
step-by-step
Open Meta Ads Manager in a new tab. You might have to do some initial setup
here.
Click the green " Create " button to start a new Campaign. Choose " Sales ."
Scroll down and open the optional pane. Name the campaign “Audience Explorer
Campaign”. You’re not going to spend any money on it. We're only using this to
explore the interface.
Name the ad set you’re making “Test”. Skip making an ad. Then click Continue.
Next, click into your Test ad set and scroll down to Audience controls targeting.
Ignore everything else.
1. Fill out the specific Locations you're targeting (for example, if you are an
ecomm company in the US, just do the US).
2. Expand show more options
3. Add a minimum targeting age if relevant (18 years have terrible buying
power)
4. Exclude any custom audiences (like your existing users)
Note: All other targeting will be done using Advantage+ audiences because
those leverage Meta's AI.
Then scroll down to Advantage+ audience to search through the actual
audiences. You can then search through
1. Your custom audiences
2. Your lookalike audiences
3. Detailed targeting options like we'll cover in the rest of this lesson
Quick note on detailed targeting. AND targeting and OR targeting

Let's say you sell super niche shirts for Java programmers who love cheesecake.

Truly terrible—but we're not here to judge, we're here to sell.

HOW you configure the targeting can mean you either target Java Programmers OR
cheesecake lovers, or specifically Java Programmers who also love cheesecake.

Java Programmers OR cheesecake lovers example

Here's an example of targeting one or the other. You can see it's an audience size of 16
to 18M people.

Java Programmers AND cheesecake lovers example

Here's an example of targeting the venn diagram of BOTH together. You can see it's a
way smaller audience:

To do this audience overlap, click Define further:

Interest-based audiences: strategy
For companies selling niche products with a specific audience, interest-based targeting
lets you hone in on them. How niche your product is affects how narrowly you should
set your targeting criteria.

Imagine you have a food ordering and delivery app that specializes in barbecue.

Targeting a high-level interest category like Food may not be very practical because not
all foodies like barbecue (like vegetarians or health freaks)

Instead, you should more specifically target people interested in barbecue to increase
conversions for your ads.

As another example, if you were advertising a web design tool, you could target people
who like related niche products like Photoshop or Figma. These people will probably
convert better than those who Meta lumps into the "Web Design" category of interests.
Anyone who likes niche design tools likely knows more about web design than someone
who once shared a blog post about web design.

Interest-based audiences: step-by-step example
Let’s say your product is a dog food delivery service targeting dog owners. You
shouldn't target the “Dogs” interest. It’s too broad.

There are too many people who like dogs but don’t own dogs.

Instead, target products that owners would uniquely use: IAMs, Purina, Chewy.com,
PETCO, etc.

Type what dog owners are uniquely interested in into the box.

In general, shoot for a Broad audience as that will help the AI do its best work.

Phase 2: Repeat for other interests
Go through Phase 1 again for all your audience's other possible interests.

We might end up with the following ad sets, with the following interests inside them:

Interests

● Interests: Online Dog Product Retailers
○ BarkBox
○ Chewy.com
● Interests: Dog Foods
○ Purina Pet Care
○ Iams
● Interests: Pet-related Activities
○ Dog training
○ Dog walking
○ Dog park
We recommend typing all of these ad sets in a separate document to keep track of them
before setting up your ads.

Other ideas for coming up with relevant interests

● Find similar products by browsing your product category on Amazon.
● Target competitor Facebook/Instagram pages.
● Look at the Facebook and Twitter profiles of your target customer and see what
pages they like and accounts they follow.
● Consider the content your target audience might consume: magazines,
newsletters, podcasts, YouTube channels, and books.
● Identify influencers, bloggers, and journalists they may follow.
● Think about miscellaneous interests that relate to your target customer: awards,
niche tools, conferences, and courses.
Phase 3: Behavior-based and Job Title
audiences
You can also target Facebook users based on their behaviors, which are categories
Facebook lumps users into based on their online and offline activity.

Examples include:

● Users who recently purchased a car
● Users who donate to charities
● Users who frequently purchase goods online
● Small business owners
Behavior-based audiences: step-by-step example
Browse through the different behaviors by clicking on the arrow next to Behaviors. You
may be surprised by what you find.

When you see behaviors relevant to your target audience, add them to your list of ad
sets.

With our dog food example, there are two main behaviors we’d want to target:

● Behaviors: Dog Owners
● Behaviors: Dog food and products
Job title audiences
We used to recommend targeting audiences based on job title, but with changes to
Meta algorithm, we no longer advise it. That's because people don't reliably add or
update their job title and employer info on their Facebook profiles. Since Meta is used
casually, these details aren't a priority for users. People would rather include
professional information on their LinkedIn profiles.

Because of this, the work-related info fields on user profiles may be outdated and thus
less accurate. Someone who added "Graphic Designer" to their Facebook profile years
ago might have changed careers without updating their details. So by targeting only
graphic designers, your ad set would still show to them—someone that no longer fits
your target audience.

The reverse is also possible: People who switched into a new career relevant to your
audience might not have updated their Facebook profiles. By targeting that role
specifically, you eliminate the possibility of these users seeing your ad.

Lookalike audiences: strategy
The challenge with lookalike audiences is having a sufficiently representative seed
audience to create one in the first place. Without a good seed audience, lookalike
audiences are skewed and inaccurate.

Here are two tactics to get access to a relevant seed audience:

● If you have a partner company that targets the same audience, offer to swap
Meta (or any other ad channel) pixels with them. Read more about designating
partners in your Ads Manager account here.
● Share pixels with a friendly non-competitor company in your industry or that
targets the same audience. (Companies sometimes pay to do this.)
Lookalike audiences: step-by-step example
Think about all the email lists you have access to that have more than 1,000 people in
them: customer lists, email signups, website visitors (through the Facebook pixel),
scraped emails, etc. List those out in your ad set doc—you’ll want to make lookalikes
out of all of them.

We cover this more in the next project.

Final note: budgets
You’ll need to spend 3-5 times your CAC (cost of acquiring a customer) per ad set to
test that ad set. So if your CAC is $50, expect to spend at least $150 per ad set in your
initial tests.

If you can only spend $1,000 on Meta, but you have 10 ad sets, you’ll need to combine
similar ad sets so you don’t spend as much.

Then also consider that if you have 3-5 ads per ad set, each ad will also fight for that
spend. So for small budgets it's typically better to take fewer, more targeted swings.

Project: Set up Meta Ads
This project assumes that you’ve already:

● Made your initial ad creatives. (See Ad Creatives > Project: Make Ad Creatives.)
● Set up Meta conversion tracking. (See Conversion Tracking.)
● Added a Meta payment method. (Here’s how.)
Phase 1: Set up custom audiences
Phase 1a: Website traffic
Head to Meta Ads Manager and click the All Tools hamburger menu.
Scroll down to Audiences in the sidebar.
Web traffic

Click Create audience -> Custom audience
Then choose Website , under Your Sources.
Target everyone who has visited your site in the last 2 days.
Then click Create Audience.
Do the same for:
○ 4 day visitors: Everyone who has visited your site in the last 4 days.
○ 30 day visitors: Everyone who has visited your site in the last 30 days.
○ 90 day visitors: Everyone who has visited your site in the last 90 days.
We’ll need these later.

Retargeting traffic

Head back to that same Audiences menu from the previous step.
Click Create a Custom Audience. Then choose Website , under Your Sources.
Target everyone who visited a page with the word “retarget” in the URL in the
past 60 days.
This is everyone who came to your site through a retargeting ad who you don’t want to
target again.

Customer list

If you have email lists with over 1,000 people, you’ll want to upload them. Two reasons:

You’ll want to exclude them from the ads you run to target new potential
customers.
Meta can generate lookalike audiences off that list.
Export current users’ email addresses. Note that this is a static data set (each new
email on the site won’t go on this list), so you’ll also need to upload it monthly.

But if you have Meta conversion tracking set up, you won’t have to do this again. Meta
will track every new customer, user, app install, and more on your site. Make an
audience that targets everyone who has become your customer.

Or if you have Segment, or some other integration with Facebook/Meta, you can
have customer lists dynamically sent into Meta.

Do that first. Click where it says “All website visitors” and search for your event.

Name it “30 Day Sign Ups” (or “Customers”, if you’re using the Purchase event, etc.).
Save it.

Now back to our customer email list.

Click Create a Custom Audience. Then choose Customer list under Your
Sources.
Meta will then show information like how to prepare your customer list. Download
its file template and fill it with your list of emails. Upload it. Name your audience.
Click Next.
Map your identifiers. You’ll see how it works on the screen.
Click Upload & Create. Then click Done.
If you have more than 5,000 customers, make separate lists of customers by their LTV.
If there are higher-value customers and lower-value customers, upload separate
audiences for those as well.

Other lists

Do the same thing as the Customer list for each list you have—different form
submissions, email marketing lists, support tickets, etc. Pick the appropriate type of data
source for each list.

Phase 1b: Generate lookalikes
Now we’ll create lookalikes based on your existing traffic. We’ll start with your existing
website traffic.

First lookalike

Click Audiences > Create audience >Lookalike audience. Pick your “90 day
visitors” list in the Select Your Lookalike Source field.
For location, select all countries using the "Select All" checkbox. We'll narrow this
down to the specific countries later when we set up the ad sets.
Click the Select All checkbox.
For audience size, make it 1%.
If your product broadly appeals to most consumers (e.g., food and apparel),
consider testing audiences of 2% and 7% as well. Otherwise, your lookalike's
focus will be diluted.
Click Create audience.
Other Lookalikes

Follow the same process for each of the other lists you uploaded (including email lists).

Phase 1c: Instagram followers
To exclude people who already follow your Instagram account, you'll first need to create
a custom audience.

Click Create a Custom Audience > Instagram account (under Meta Sources).

Select "Everyone who engaged with this professional account" in the past 365 days.
Note: this should be adapted to the duration of your sales cycle. For example, don't
exclude users for 365 days if they need to re-purchase every 3 months.

Phase 2: Campaign creation
Head to Ads Manager. Then click the Create button.
Make the campaign objective Sales. We almost always recommend choosing the
Sales objective for your Meta ad campaigns since this objective centers around a
traceable action that connects to your revenue.
Unless you're setting up a completely automated campaign for your ecommerce
company with an integrated product feed, then choose Manual sales campaign
instead of Advantage+ shopping campaign.
Then, name your Campaign
If you’re making a new campaign for only one product line, name your
campaign Primary or Prospecting.
If you have multiple products or product lines or, make one campaign per
product or product line. Most companies only have one product line.
For example, one product line could be “Organic dog food” and within it, there may be
multiple flavors of dog food. “Dog brushes” would be a separate product line.

Let's continue setting up the campaign.

Advantage campaign Budget Optimization (CBO)
Turning on Advantage Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) gives Meta full control to
manage your campaign budget across ad sets to get you the overall best results; it'll
spend more money on the ad sets that show promise and less on the ones that don't.

With Advantage campaign budget, you set one central campaign budget. This budget
continuously distributes in real time to ad sets with the best opportunities, throughout
the course of your campaign.

Key point: We recommend you let Meta manage the spend. If there's specific ad sets
you planned that are targeted for entirely different goals (like newsletter subs) and you
want to control the budget between sales and subscribers, then I would just recommend
creating a different campaign with that different goal.

Let's talk about how you determine your specific budget

Budget - Prospecting

A few steps to figuring this out:

● Take your acceptable CAC (what you calculated on Day 1).
● Multiply it by 3 or 5 (minimum test buffer)
● Multiply it by the number ad sets you intend to run (let's say 3)
● Then divide by 7 o 14 (because we'll run the ads for 1-2 weeks)
● Multiply it by 2 (to get data faster)
● Set that as your minimum daily ad spend (daily budget).
● No matter what, don’t spend more than $300 per day to start, unless you have a
ridiculously high LTV product (over $3,000).
Why multiply by 3 or 5?

We need a buffer in case there’s some variation in our audience that means highly
profitable or highly unprofitable people happen to see our ad first. This happens
frequently. If we can get CAC within an order of magnitude (3-5 times, maximum) of
what we want, it also leaves us room to optimize ads and the rest of the funnel to get
down to what we want.

So, if your target CAC is $50, we’ll need to spend at least $150 before we rule out an ad
set as being unprofitable. We can sometimes rule it out earlier, but $150 is the minimum
you’ll want to spend.

Why multiply by number of ad sets?

Because your campaign budget will theoretically be split over them. It may concentrate
it quickly to the winners, but this buffer also allows more budget to be spread over the
ads within the ad sets.

Why divide by 7 or 14?

We usually run ads for at least a week, and we don’t want to blow our budget too early.
People behave differently when they’re heading out for the weekend than when they’re
commuting to work on a Tuesday. We want to reduce the chance that the day of the
week affects ad performance.

If there’s a major holiday coming up, consider running a test a different week. Not to say
you shouldn’t run ads for Black Friday. But don’t expect those results to generalize to a
normal workweek.

Why multiply by 2: Now, take your budget and multiply it by 2. Set it as your daily
budget. But set a reminder to lower your budget back to 3/7 CAC after three days.

Why? Students have overwhelmingly told us it's worth the tradeoff to get data sooner
and see results even if the data is affected by the day of the week.

So, if your target CAC is $50 and you intend to run ads for at least a week over 3 ad
sets, your usual budget would be $64.29 (5033/7*2). Set your budget to $130 for three
days instead, then revert to $65—SET A REMINDER!

We know this is convoluted, but you'll get important data faster.

Budget - Retargeting - 4 day Ad Set

Spend aggressively to retarget 4 day visitors. They've just seen your ad and they're
higher intent.

The rule of thumb is: divide your total reach by 500. But don’t spend less than $5 per
day. You can see this when you plug in your retargeting audience.

So if your audience is 6,000, your daily budget would be $12.

Budget - Retargeting - 180 day Ad Set

Divide your total reach by 1,000. Example: If your reach is 6,000, your budget would be
$6.

Budget scheduling

Run as ongoing unless there’s a special case. Meta will generally outperform you here.

Campaign bid strategy

You have a few options for how you want Meta to optimize:

If you already know exactly how much you're willing to spend per acquisition (like $50),
then choose Cost per result goal.

If your goal is a purchase event with revenue assigned, you can choose ROAS.

Otherwise, you can just use Highest volume.

Advantage+ catalog ads
If you are an ecommerce company with a lot of products, then it might be worth testing
Advantage+ catalog ads. To do that you'd need to create a product catalogue (which
might be pulled in via a feed from your Shopify site).

But, we'd probably recommend that for the future. For now let's try targeting our top
products.

Phase 3: Ad set creation
We’re going to make separate ad sets for each group of ads you've created.

A reminder that an ad set is primarily two things:

● A collection of ads
● Specific targeting options
For your purposes, break up and name Ad Sets based on the different segments of
people you're targeting—and not the specific value props being targeted in the ads.

You'll want to name your ad sets clearly based on WHO it's targeting so it's
crystal clear for you and everyone else on the team what it's for.

Creating your ad sets
After configuring the campaign you're start creating your first Ad Set.

Name your ad set after the audience you want to test.

For example, you could structure your prospecting campaign to have separate ad sets
targeting different audiences: 1% Top Customers (Lookalikes), Marketers (Interest), and
Developers (Interest).

Phase 3a: Conversion event
Next, choose the conversion event you want. We want this event to be as far down the
funnel as possible—ideally, a purchase event.

Here's an example where I used Cost per result goal on the Campaign level, and then
chose the Purchase event with a target cost per result of $50.

In almost all cases you'll want the Performance goal to be "Maximize number of
conversions."

Why might you not choose a Purchase goal?

It’s often hard to get enough data on purchases because so many people can drop out
of the funnel before buying, especially if you don’t have much traffic on your site.
Particularly if you have an expensive product, a long sales cycle, or a lot of steps
that someone needs to take in order to purchase.

So you can use an earlier conversion event that happens more often—for example,
registrations or email signups, or clicking on the Landing Page CTA—until you have
enough volume to use the purchase event. You’ll want your event to happen at least 50
times in about a week.

Use the Meta pixel for websites, or your Meta SDK installation if you’re sending users to
a mobile app. Over time, Meta will show more of the ads that convert better, and less of
the ads that don’t.

For both prospecting and retargeting ads , you can leave optimization and delivery
options on their default settings with Cost per result goal empty.

It should look like this:

Why? If we optimized for something other than conversions, we might get people who
like the ad or our landing page, but who don’t actually buy. At the end of the day, we
want to focus on customers who actually pay.

“1 day view” means they could have seen your ad and then Googled the product. We
want to make sure we give the ad credit.

Phase 3b: Dynamic creatives
These are being or have been phased out (depending on when you're reading this)

3c: Targeting
In our Meta targeting lesson and the Generate Audience and Ad Sets project, we
discussed the benefits of various targeting strategies, including:

● Custom audiences
● Lookalike audiences
● Interest and behavior targeting
This point of the campaign creation process—the ad set level—is where you actually set
your targeting parameters.

You should have separate ad sets for each group you plan to target.

And we'll default to using Advantage+ audiences for prospecting campaigns to let
the AI help.

Do not mix audiences, e.g., setting a lookalike audience with targeting parameters for
location and age group. Multiple ad sets may have identical creatives but use different
targeting filters; this setup aims to test which audience or targeting filters work best.

Custom audiences

Use the custom audiences you created in Phase 1a for retargeting ads (targeting
people who have already been to your site). You can find the names of these audiences
in the Custom Audiences field, e.g., 30 day visitors, 90 day visitors.

Do Retargeting campaigns using regular Audience targeting, not Advantage+

If you’re running lead gen ads, it’s almost always worth setting up a retargeting ad set
for people who have filled out a lead form. You can do this by making a custom
audience in the “Audiences” section from Phase 1.

Lookalike audiences

Select the lookalike audience you created in Phase 1b in the Custom Audiences field.

Do lookalikes using Advantage+ audiences.

When you’re making lookalike ad sets, you can also make multiple ad sets based on
demographic data. For example, depending on your product, you might make a
lookalike off of your existing customers and then split it to make separate ad sets for
men and women, or for people over or under 35.

Again, avoid layering interests and lookalikes. Meta'a interest data is iffy, and you’re not
reaching enough people to miss out on the folks Meta mistakenly can’t capture.
(Assuming your audience is less than about 5 million people—which it generally is for
the 1% lookalikes we recommend.)

Interest targeting

Whether you're using a broad or narrow interest targeting strategy, remember to avoid
hyper-targeting. Use targeting filters only to avoid showing your ads to people outside of
your market.

Use Advantage+ audiences for interest targeting.

For basic demographic targeting, follow the instructions in our Location, Age, Gender,
and Language Targeting reading.

Audience exclusions

For each of your ad sets, set audiences to exclude based on what group of people
you're targeting.

Some guidelines:

● For your prospecting ads (designed to reach brand new users), exclude people
who have already interacted with your company. It makes sense to exclude these
audiences if you have a more specific campaign already targeting them, e.g.,
retargeting ads.
○ Examples: People who already like your Facebook page, Instagram
followers, people who have visited key web pages and/or performed
actions like added to cart, people who have installed your app in the last
180 days, your 90 day visitors list.
○ Should your prospecting ads exclude current customers or past
purchasers? Some nuances here:
■ If you’re selling a service that can only be purchased once (e.g.,
SaaS subscription), exclude people who like your page.
■ If you can have repeat purchases (e.g, an ecommerce company),
it’s okay to keep advertising to the same audience.
● For your retargeting ads, exclude the following audiences:
○ 2 day visitors (we don’t want to spam them right after they’ve failed to
convert)
■ Note: You can test excluding recent visitors anywhere from 2 days
to 180 days. 2 is the standard we use at Demand Curve, but this is
not a rigid rule. Some purchasing decisions take longer.
○ Converted Users
○ 60 day retargeted Users
3e: Placements
Select Advantage+ placements (recommended) rather than Manual Placements. This
option gives Meta's algorithm more control—it'll optimize placement delivery of your ads
for better results.

3f: Confirm and turn off
Review your changes and confirm! Close the creator window. Then turn the ad set off
in the Ads Manager dashboard. The toggle should be gray, not blue, to show that it's not
currently active.

Why? You still need to make ads and we want to finish doing all the ad sets first.

Repeat this phase (Phase 3) to create the other ad sets in your campaign. Pay special
attention to targeting options (Phase 3c) for each ad set.

You should have ad sets for each separate audience you want to target, or for each
group of creatives you want to test. Once these ad sets are set up, move on to the next
phase (ad creation).

Phase 4: Ad creation
We’re now going to add ads to each ad set. Click the name of an ad set to do this. Then
click the green “Create” button to create an ad.

To start off, we’ll make one of your image ads.

4a: Name
Name your ad using a differentiated piece of copy across ads. Typically, this is the copy
from its creative or from its text if its creative is light on copy. If your ad is a video, it can
be a catchy line from the video.

We name ads this way to make it easier to compare how different copy is doing once
ads are live. If we used generic or short names for ads, it would be extra work to see
what’s performing well.

4b: Identity
Choose the business' Facebook page. Connect the business’ Instagram account if you
haven’t yet.

4c: Ad setup and creative
Select the ad type (e.g., flexible, single image or video, carousel, or collection) and
upload your ad creative.

Flexible ads let you upload up to 10 creatives, 5 Primary Texts, 5 Headlines, and 5
Descriptions and Meta will mix and match which they think will perform best.

The rest you specifically upload creatives and give it one Primary Text, Headline, and
Description.

In general, I think giving Meta the option to experiment is a great idea so I
recommend using Flexible, but if you'd like tighter control, then use Single Image
or Video, or Carousel.

Remember to follow Meta's recommendations for different formats and placements'
aspect ratios.

A few guidelines for video ads:

● Make sure it has captions. Have Meta review the captions unless you’re in a
pinch.
● Create an enticing thumbnail. Users should want to know what happens next;
the right thumbnail gets many more people to click and actually watch the video.
○ For example, if your product is high-quality pork snacks, your thumbnail
might be an image of the snacks being cooked in the oven—the viewer
will want to see what the finished food looks like.
Ad copy

Primary Text is the text that appears at the top of a newsfeed ad, above the creative.
Headline is the copy that appears below the creative, followed by Description.

We recommend keeping all of your copy in a master doc or spreadsheet for testing
purposes.

If you have slight variations of the same copy, Meta also allows you test to running
alternate options. When you click into the text fields, an Add Options button will
appear. Add 1-2 more variations if you'd like (this is optional).

Some copywriting guidelines:

● Primary Text: Whenever you're targeting a specific interest (i.e. MyFitnessPal,
FitBit, Healthy eaters, etc.), call it out in the first sentence of the copy.
● Headline : If the headline is multiple sentences, use periods. If the headline is a
single sentence, leave off the period.
● Description: This should be the "social proof" copy in your ad copy doc.
Call to action

For prospecting ads , default to "Learn more" or "Shop Now" (for ecommerce
companies). They tend to perform the best.

For retargeting ads , default to "Sign Up" or "Book Now"—or whatever is most
appropriate given the product/service. In essence, move further down funnel with your
CTA text.

4d: Destination
Add the URL of your ad landing page—where users will go after clicking on your ad. Do
not include tracking parameters yet; this will be done in the Tracking section. Do not
include a? at the end.

Then set a "clean" display link for your site. Skip the "www." here.

For example, your display link should show fictitiousdogfood.com, even if the ad really
takes them to a landing page like fictiousdogfood.com/fall-promo or a subdomain like
stores.fictitiousdogfood.com.

4e: Tracking
To track which ads are getting users to your site, take advantage of Meta's dynamic
UTM parameters. These tags automatically populate details from your ads so you can
quickly understand the exact source of your traffic in Google Analytics.

You can set up these parameters under the Tracking section at the ad level. Click Build
a URL Parameter.

Here's how we recommend setting up your URL parameters:

● Campaign Source: {{site_source_name}}
○ There are four possible values: fb (Facebook); ig (Instagram); msg
(Messenger); an (Audience Network).
● Campaign Medium: {{placement}}
○ There are six possible self-explanatory values: Facebook_Desktop_Feed;
Facebook_Mobile_Feed; Facebook_Right_Column; Messenger_Home;
Instagram_Feed; Instagram_Stories.
● Campaign Name: {{campaign.name}}_((adset.name}}
○ We use two dynamic tags here so you can see which campaign and ad
set the ad belongs to.
● Campaign Content: {{ad.name}}
○ Find out which specific ad drove users to your site.

Your setup should look like this:

Phase 5: Create other ads in the same
ad set
Repeat phase 4 to create other ads in the same ad set. You can play around with
duplicating ads to save yourself time.

We recommend creating 3-6 ads per ad set.

If you have a smaller budget, aim for the lower end of this spectrum. This way, you can
collect more data per ad. With too many ads in a single ad set and a limited budget, you
won't get enough data to determine which creatives are actually effective. Aim for
around 10,000 impressions per creative for more accurate data.

When it comes to ad creative experimentation, focus on variety. Try different visual
elements, copy, and formats. Approach your product from many different angles. The
idea is to test drastically different ads to see which drive more results; then tweak and
adjust based on your observations.

Publish each ad set after you duplicate ads to it; this “saves” your changes (make sure
your campaign and ad sets are off). Meta starts to act weird and confusing if you
duplicate too many ad sets at once.

Meta's algorithm skews your ad spend toward the top-performing creatives in an ad set.
Sometimes it jumps to conclusions very early, showing what it perceives to be the most
successful ads more frequently than others. So even if one ad appears to be more
successful than others in the same ad set, take this with a grain of salt. You should
relaunch ads at different times to see if anything changes—don't rule out ad creatives
based on a single session of being live.

Phase 6: Review and publish
Review both your ad sets and ads.

Set the reminders from our Ad Optimization reading.

Then click that big blue button to turn on your Meta ads.

How to Measure and Test Ad
Performance
We'll cover how to measure and test your ads' performance in this lesson. Before diving
in, though, we first recommend customizing your default ads dashboard and creating

custom performance metrics in Meta Ads Manager. We advise doing this because the
default performance view in Ads Manager isn’t very actionable.

First, here's how to create custom metrics. (We'll create a few custom ones for your new
default view.)

In Meta Ads Manager, navigate to the Ads Reporting page, and click Customize.
Select the Metrics tab. Scroll down to Custom Metrics , where any custom
metrics you've created are listed.
Click the Create button to fill out a custom metric creation form. You'll then need
to complete the form, name your metric, and click Create Metric.
What custom metrics should you create? For a more detailed look at your ads'
performance, we suggest these four:

● Average order value: The average amount spent by a customer. Use a numeric
format and calculate this as website purchases conversion value divided by
website purchases.
● Add to cart to purchase ratio: The rate of users who added something to their
cart and completed their purchase. Use a percentage format and calculate this
as website purchases divided by adds to cart.
● Goal conversion rate: A custom measure based on your desired conversion
goal. For example, if your goal is to get more lead signups, you can set this
metric as the number of signups divided by total ad reach.
● Thumb stop rate: A measure of whether ads grab users’ attention in their feed
(by getting their thumb to stop scrolling). Use a percentage format and calculate
this as 3-second video plays divided by impressions.
Once you've finished creating these custom metrics, customize your default ads view.

Navigate to Meta Ads Manager. Click on the Columns icon, which looks like
three vertically oriented rectangles. Click Customize Columns at the bottom of
the menu.
A Customize Columns window will appear, showing your dashboard's current
data columns and others you can add. Check and uncheck the boxes of the
metrics that you want to appear in your dashboard, including your custom
metrics. (We'll give specific recommendations about which metrics to include
after this.)
Once complete, click the Apply button at the bottom of the Customize Columns
window. The columns you've specified will now show up in Ads Manager.
Click the Columns icon again. Save and name your custom view. Then click Set
as Default.
Now, every time you open Ads Manager, your default view will be updated with the
metrics you've checked.

Which metrics should you include? For a high-level view of your account’s health, we
recommend:

● Campaign/Ad set name: For easy sorting and identification purposes.
● Delivery: This metric tells you if any of your ads have been rejected. Meta will
usually tell you why, e.g., too much text, inappropriate content, etc.
● Budget: How much your ads can spend per day.
● Amount spent: How much you’ve spent over the time period you’re looking at.
● Results: This is Meta's version of conversions—it uses the term "results" since
not all campaign objectives are necessarily conversion-focused.
● Cost per result: One of the most important metrics for judging your ads'
effectiveness, this tells you how much you paid per ad per conversion.
● Link clicks: This refers to your ads' clickthrough rate, the number of users
actually clicking on your ad.
● Reach: How many distinct people saw your ad (any number of times). We
generally advise letting your ads reach at least 1,200 before drawing any
conclusions about your data.
● CPM (Cost per 1,000 impressions): Use this metric to understand how
competitive your audience is.
● Frequency: How many times each reached person has seen your ad. This
metric is important for avoiding ad fatigue. Ideally, users shouldn't see your ad
more than twice in a very short time frame (like less than a week).
● Goal conversion rate: Create this custom metric based on your campaign's
exact goals, e.g., email signup or purchase. Use it to understand whether people
are taking action from your ad.
AIDA framework
To understand how your ad creatives are doing, we recommend creating another
custom dashboard view in Ads Manager with metrics from the AIDA framework. The
AIDA framework describes how users decide whether or not to buy something,
separated into four stages. Apply this framework to your ad creatives to gauge their
effectiveness:

Attention: Does your ad grab people’s attention? Look at its thumb stop rate, a
custom metric showing how often users will pause on an ad. The thumb stop rate
tells you if your ad’s hook was enticing enough to get users to stop scrolling.
○ Aim for at least 10%; the higher, the better. We’ve seen thumb stop rates
as high as 57%.
Interest: Does your ad sustain people’s attention? This stage is most applicable
to video and carousel ads because there’s no good metric for evaluating static
image ads. Gauge people’s interest by looking at video average play time or
carousel engagement.
○ Also look at your video ads’ drop-off data to find out at what point users
stop watching your video ad. This will give you an idea of how much
information they’ve gotten through. You can find this data by clicking the
View Charts option of any video ad listed in Ads Manager. This will take
you to the Performance Overview page; scroll down to find the Video
Performance chart. Note that your video ad needs a minimum of 1,000
plays in order to display this data.
○ In the example below, most users drop off after the first second—so it’s no
wonder this ad hasn’t gotten any conversions.
Desire: Does your ad make users want to learn more? Look at link clicks, Meta's
version of clickthrough rate (CTR), to gauge your ad’s effectiveness here.
○ Meta offers several different CTRs, which include clicks to your
Facebook/Instagram page and clicks on something other than your CTA.
We recommend looking at link clicks specifically because it looks only at
clicks on your CTA button.
Action: Do users convert after seeing your ad? The cost per result metric, which
is Meta's version of CPA, measures the amount spent per whatever conversion
chosen for your ad objective, like purchase or app install.
○ Cost per result also helps gauge whether Meta ads are a sustainable
acquisition channel based on your margin. We recommend budgeting a
number no more than ⅓ of your customer LTV.
○ Example: If your customer LTV is $150, you should aim for a $50 cost per
result. Use the rest of the AIDA framework to test and improve upon
different aspects of your ad creatives to reach this target—we’ll cover
testing in more detail next.
How to test ad creatives
We didn’t give benchmarks for every AIDA metric earlier because every business is
different. There’s rarely a universal benchmark to measure your ads against—having
one might even mislead you to think an ad is performing better than it really is, or vice
versa.

So how do you know which ads are actually working?

Many people look only at an ad’s cost per result, but really, they should look at each
metric outlined in the AIDA framework. This data tells you which aspects of an ad need
improvement.

Starting out, use your first few ads to establish a baseline of ad performance for
each of your AIDA metrics. You should be testing multiple ads at once, not just one at
a time. Compare each of the metrics to see which ads are performing well or poorly. For
example, you may find that one video ad has a very high link CTR; this may mean your
other ads need more improvement in the desire stage.

Finding a target threshold to aim for with each metric will be specific to your company.
This is a learning process based on continually comparing your ads against one
another.

Here are some ideas for improving your ads based on data:

● For video ads with a low thumb stop rate (under 10%), reevaluate the first frame.
Try a different hook to keep users from scrolling past.
○ From our experience, creating an enticing hook is where most companies
struggle. For video ads, make your first 3 seconds pop. For static image
ads, use a top-down approach so that the most important elements
appear first.
● Look at your video ads’ drop-off data and map the biggest drop-off points in your
video. What happens at those points? Is it after the first cut? Is there a long
headline? Maybe your ad took too long to get to the point.
● If an ad’s CTR is low, it may not be creating enough desire in users. Try a
different CTA—or a different offer altogether. For example, offer a free trial
instead of a discount code.
● If conversion rates are low, revisit your ad landing page. Does it accurately build
on your ad? For example, if you’re advertising a free gift, you shouldn’t direct
users to the homepage; instead, take them to a page with instructions for
redeeming that gift.
○ More broadly, continue the same messaging used in your ad on your
landing page. Vidyard does that by featuring the same characters in both
its video ad and landing page so that the page feels like an extension of
the same story.

● Alternatively, if conversion rates are low, consider revisiting your signup or order
form, whatever process users have to go through to convert. Can it be made
shorter to reduce friction?
Experiment with radically different concepts, especially if you’re not seeing many
conversions. This also applies to ad format; if you’ve only used static images, try video,
and vice versa. Trying very different creatives will give you a wider sample of data to
learn from. Consider how BambooHR runs both video and static image ads with very
different creatives and copy.

Also don’t wait for Meta's learning phase to finish to decide whether to keep running a
particular ad. The recommendation to reach 50 conversions isn’t one-size-fits-all and
will inevitably vary for different industries and products. Your goal is to determine if an
ad works for a given moment in time by comparing it against others within the same ad
set. Pause underperforming ads—those with the highest cost per result, getting the
fewest clicks, etc.

This doesn't mean your lowest-performing ads should be turned off forever, though. You
should relaunch them again later. Meta's algorithm uses an auction system to deliver
ads; this means your ads are always competing against other advertisers’. You need to
test them repeatedly to find out what works best at any given point in time—don’t
discount your ads based on a single period of testing.

Many advertisers think the goal of testing is finding out which of your ads is objectively
the best—but this isn’t the right mindset for Meta. Instead, find out what Meta's
algorithm likes at this specific moment.

Testing your ads is an ongoing process, but over time, you’ll notice trends. The goal is
to find a winning ad concept and then optimize your targeting settings based on this
data. This will lower your ad spend and make your ads more efficient.

Don’t expect today’s top-performing ad to work as well six months from now. Winning ad
concepts get saturated with ad spend over time. Their target audience sees them,
reacts, and then moves on because competitors are doing the same thing and the ad is
no longer so compelling.

For continuous results with Meta ads, you’ll need to constantly develop new creatives
and test them—then optimize them based on their performance.

Meta Ad Optimization
The goal of optimization: Make your ads more efficiently reach your target audience
(with efficiency defined by cost). In an ideal world, your ads should get users to convert
for as low of a price as possible.

Here’s a quick high-level overview of the overall optimization process:

Identify underperforming ad assets based on cost per result (CPR) , whether
that’s at the campaign, ad set, or ad level.
Turn off the underperformers—the ad assets that are driving the most expensive
conversions or not getting any. Don’t delete them. The point of turning them off
for now is to conserve your ad spend for more efficient assets currently driving
cheaper conversions. (Later, it’s worth turning on the underperformers again for
another test.)
Break down your ad assets by more detailed user data. Make observations on
how your ad assets are performing based on this data. (We’ll walk through this
process below.)
Adjust your ad assets based on your observations. Depending on how you’ve
organized your campaign, your observations could inspire new hypotheses about
your product or audience. You could test these by adjusting your targeting
parameters, tweaking existing creatives, or introducing brand new ad concepts.
Let’s dive into an example with optimization focused at the ad set level.

In our example, we’ve created a prospecting campaign with ad sets testing different
hypotheses about our product with a broad targeting strategy. Each ad set has very
specific ad creatives about a particular product feature, and they’re grouped
accordingly.

At the ad set level, we’ll look at more detailed user data to see if some product features
resonated more with specific users and thus got better results.

To start this analysis, we’ll first click the Breakdown button, which appears in the top
right of the Ads Manager’s dashboard.

After clicking this button, Meta will show breakdown options organized by Time,
Delivery, and Action (and Dynamic Creative Element, if you’re using dynamic creatives).

Example: Optimizing by gender
Let’s start by looking at gender—that is, how your ad set performance varied based on
users' gender. The gender breakdown appears in the By Delivery menu.

Looking at this breakdown, you might observe that some of your ad sets perform better
with men than women, or vice versa.

For example, in our screenshot, Ad Set 1’s creatives achieved a significantly lower CPR
among women (€1.78) compared to men (€2.45).

The reach and impressions between the two genders aren’t equal, probably because
Meta's algorithm noticed this difference in performance and began showing Ad Set 1 to
more women.

Still, based on this data, we might consider adjusting Ad Set 1’s settings to target only
female audiences. We’ll make a note of this for later, and then continue our analysis by
looking at other variables. Why? It's possible there are more nuances in how users are
responding to our ads.

Example: Optimizing by age
Once again, click the Breakdown button to pick a new data point. Let’s try analyzing
next by age to see if any ad sets did better with a particular age group.

After clicking Age, the dashboard will change to show data about ad set performance
according to different age ranges.

In our example, it’s clear Ad Set 1 did best among users between ages 18 and 34, with
CPRs below the overall average (€1.84).

But after age 34, the CPR of users increases with each subsequent age bracket. The
most expensive conversions took place in the 55-64 group, although the number of
impressions in this group is too low to make a definitive conclusion.

Based on this data, however, it may be worth adjusting Ad Set 1 to target only users
between ages 18 and 34 to see how results are affected.

From an ad standpoint, it might also be worth creating and testing new creatives
designed for specific age groups. After all, looking at the data, the narrower 25-34 age
range had the lowest CPR (€1.48). It's about 13% lower than the 18-24 age range
(€1.69), which could mean there's a difference between how Gen Z and millennial
audiences respond to your ads.

Further optimization
We’ve gone through our example analysis by gender and age—but this is just the start.
Remember that the goal of optimization is to make your ads more efficient in reaching
users by finding out who they're most effective at converting. Breaking down your ad
sets’ performance by more detailed criteria helps you get an idea of which user
segments your ad sets performed best with.

Here are some other data points worth looking at:

● Age and gender: See if there’s a specific demographic combination your ads do
especially well or poorly with. For example, maybe younger males convert more
than older males for one particular ad set.
● Impression device: Meta separates this data by operating system, like Android
Smartphone, iPhone, iPad, etc. So you can use this breakdown to make
optimization decisions based on operating system, but you can also more
broadly look at whether users were more likely to convert on mobile, tablet, or
desktop.
● Platform: See if users converted more when they saw your ad on Facebook or
Instagram.
● Placement: Along the same lines as platform, find out which placements
converted more users.
● Region: If you sell your product nationwide, region might help you identify if
certain states, provinces, or other areas responded more to your ads. But you
need a lot of data for this breakdown to be meaningful; otherwise, it’s not a fair
comparison of different regions.
We’ve only looked at Ad Set 1 for this example, but you should look across all of your
ad sets. They may have very different results, e.g., Ad Set 2 drove more conversions
among men above age 40 while there wasn’t any big difference in age for Ad Set 3.

You may also notice some ad sets that have significantly higher CPRs or didn’t drive
any conversions.

For example, a few people who saw Ad Set 3 added to their cart, but ultimately no one
checked out. Meanwhile, Ad Set 2 got more people to add to their cart; of these, 2 made
a purchase.

Rather than trying to optimize the targeting settings of your poorly performing ad sets,
turn them off. (Remember, don’t delete them.)

It’s possible the ad creatives in these underperformers just didn’t land well with
users—but you also can’t make this conclusion based on a single session of testing.
Turn on these low-performing ad sets at another time to test them again.

Remember that you're not trying to find out which of your ad assets are objectively the
best; rather, you're trying to find out what Meta's algorithm likes right now.

We know companies that rebooted old campaigns that didn't work well in their first
run—but a year later, ended up working. And we've also seen the opposite happen.
Along the same lines, we've seen that duplicating and relaunching entire campaigns at
a later time can also make a difference, especially those targeting broad audiences.

The bottom line: Running successful ads on Facebook and Instagram requires
constant experimentation. Apart from creating a variety of ad concepts to test, you
should also look at performance data at the ad, ad set, and campaign levels. Look for
trends in your data, and then optimize accordingly.

Locations, Ages, Genders, and Language
Targeting
Locations
Geography is the most significant demographic determinant of cost-per-impression. It's
also the criterion that most limits your total audience volume.

So let's begin our ad set targeting with a discussion on geography! It's like you're back
in high school!

First, note you'll probably want to select the "People who live in this location" dropdown
option. This is in contrast to people who "are in " or "were recently in" your list of
locations. Usually, the purpose of targeting by geography is to show your ad to people
who have homes in that location and live there most of the year.

Second, know that countries split into three unofficial advertising "tiers:"

● Tier 1
○ Australia
○ Canada
○ Denmark
○ France
○ Germany
○ Ireland
○ Netherlands
○ New Zealand
○ Norway
○ Sweden
○ Switzerland
○ United Kingdom
○ United States
● Tier 2
○ Austria
○ Belgium
○ Czechia
○ Estonia
○ Hong Kong
○ Ireland
○ Israel
○ Italy
○ Poland
○ Singapore
○ Spain
● Tier 3
○ Brazil
○ China
○ India
○ South Korea
○ China
Tier 1

These are the most expensive countries to target. (They cost within 20% of each other.)
They're expensive because their populations are more likely to buy higher-priced goods
online. So they're most in demand by advertisers.

Of these countries, target all the ones your business can service. Then examine your ad
performance to determine which performs poorly. Remove them.

Tier 2

This is the next tier down. Their populations are less likely to speak English fluently,
which limits their appeal to most big-budget advertisers. Plus, they're less likely to have
high purchasing power or are simply less likely to purchase goods online.

Only target these if you have a specific reason or feel like experimenting.

Tier 3

One tier down, you should only target these countries if you have a specific reason. And
you generally only want to target their capital cities ; avoid wasting money on the
outskirts that are less likely to be able to afford your goods.

Remaining countries

The unlisted countries generally have negligibly small populations or are developing
countries with negligible purchasing power, Internet access, and/or buying intent.

You can always begin by targeting countries you think are most likely to convert. This
keeps your spending efficient while you test your initial set of ads. Over time, you'll add
or remove countries based on the performance you see.

Retargeting
Don’t restrict by location if you’re creating a retargeting ad set (see Acquisition >
Retargeting). We can check on low-converting locations later.

Gender and age
Unless you have a specific reason, avoid restricting by these criteria for your initial ad
set tests. Instead, keep your targeting broad, then parse your ads' performance by the
gender and age groups of the people who converted.

You should always let the data tell you who to target. Don't go on gut feel. See which
demographics had the lowest CPA then refine your targeting from there.

That said, there is a rule of thumb: For most products that aren't explicitly targeting a
younger demographic, targeting ages 22 to 45 keeps you within the bounds of those
most likely to make Internet purchases.

Only break down ad sets by age (e.g., making one ad set targeting 22-30 year olds and
another targeting 31-40 year olds) if showing them different copy and creatives
makes sense. For most products, this won’t be the case.

Language
Assuming you're marketing in English, explicitly target English speakers if you're
targeting countries where the majority doesn't speak English. (Or target English anyway,
just to be safe at the expense of slightly narrowing your audience volume.

For example, Germany has a lot of English speakers, but also a lot of people who don’t
speak much English (who you wouldn’t want to target with ads). So it would make sense
to specify English as a language if you’re targeting Germany.

If you are targeting an English-speaking country such as the US or the UK, leave this
field blank. The odds are that nearly everyone seeing your ad can understand English
well enough to get the gist and consider whether they want to convert.

If you do explicitly target "English," you're missing out on Facebook users who have
their UI language set to something other than English but speak English. For example, a
teenager (it’s always a teenager) may set their language to “Pirate”. Yes, that’s a real
language on Facebook. (Arrreal language? OK. We’re done.)

Saving Audiences
To save yourself time, close the window, pop open your OLD campaign, and save the audience
for the best-performing ad set.

To do that: click “Edit” under your OLD campaign’s ad set:
2.
Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the “Audience” section. Hit “Save This Audience”
and name it.
4.
Now, the next time you create an ad set, you can select the saved audience you just
created.
6.
LinkedIn Quirks
LinkedIn's platform has some quirks and issues. There are a few things you should
know before you run ads on it:

Don’t bother with LinkedIn if your site isn’t
mobile-friendly
75% of people visit LinkedIn on their phones.

Also, for the main ad type that works (called “Sponsored Content” ads, we’ll get into it
later) the UI doesn’t give you the option to restrict your ads only to desktop users. Don’t
quadruple your costs.

It’s a pain to delete ads
When you’re setting up ads, it’s often not worth the time to go and delete an ad if you
screw up. Just make a new one and title it “V2”.

Sponsored content errors
If you try to sponsor one piece of content at a time, you’ll sometimes run into an error
message. Make sure you create all your sponsored content, then select all of them and
hit “Sponsor Content” for the smoothest experience.

LinkedIn conversion tracking sucks
When someone clicks through a LinkedIn ad and buys on your website, there’s a 50%
chance that LinkedIn will record it correctly.

This means it’s on you to optimize your ads correctly. Specifically...

Send as many UTM tags as possible
Make sure you’re using every major UTM parameter you can, specifically the
utm_campaign and the utm_creative. Check out our reading on UTM tags and
templates to learn more about it.

Don’t just look at the LinkedIn UI to interpret your ad
results. Look at your analytics tool
In Google Analytics, we’ll make a custom report that only shows LinkedIn traffic, broken
down by campaign. We measure the number of purchase events.

Here’s an example of how we do it, using one of our clients.

Hit “+New Custom Report”.

When you’re trying to calculate your CAC or your CPA, pull the total amount spent from
LinkedIn, and pull the total number of purchases (or installs, etc.) from your analytics
tool.

LinkedIn Tactics
Targeting
● LinkedIn understands 50% of job titles. So not only are you limiting volume by
only targeting job titles, you’ll also be paying slightly higher CPC’s since these
are the go-to people for anyone new to LinkedIn ads. The demand drives the
cost up.
● If suitable for your product, leadgen a whitelist of companies and target them
directly. Pair with job functions and seniority.
● To expand total audience, go beyond job title targeting. Pair these with
seniority: groups, skills, and job functions. Find skills and groups only a
{{marketer}} would have.
● When targeting decision-makers in IT, for example, don’t make a single
campaign for all managers.
○ Instead, create 1 for managers, 1 for directors, 1 for VP’s, and 1 for
CXO/partner/owner. Now we can understand engagement rates and lower
CPC’s.
● The title "Senior" describes someone who manages projects/products/services
but not actually people. For that, target "managers" and "directors."
● Age is inferred. It's more accurate to pair job function with seniority than to
narrow by age. Unless you really need to.
CTAs
● Don’t run ads for a signup CTA. They won’t work. Run ads for gated content.
Get emails in exchange for content. Then qualify the email leads and reach out to
them yourself.
● Viable content types include Guides, Whitepapers, eBooks, and Webinars.
Webinars work best for closing leads because you can sell better on a call — but
are the most work. The rest work equally well, e.g. “The five things you’re doing
wrong with programmatic advertising.”
● Content niche should be chosen so that the only viable solution to the
problem/topic is your exact product. Balance this with going broad enough
that you have a sizeable audience.
● Your ultimate goal here is getting their email. Once you have that, you can follow
up later.
Creative and copy
● Go crazy with long text if you want. There’s no 20% text rule like Facebook has.
Budgeting and optimization
● Under budgeting options, never use the "even distribution" feature. It hurts
performance and pricing across the board.
● With CPC bidding, you’re charged for clicks on the company page and the CTA.
About 5% of clicks are to the company page. Social actions and hashtag clicks
are free.
● Unlike Facebook, which works to give you the best price per impression/click,
LinkedIn performs no such optimizations. So you need to aggressively intervene
if you want to be maximally cost-efficient.
● Whenever a campaign has a 0.8-1.0% CTR (as LinkedIn reports it), it’s cheaper
to edit the campaign to use CPM bidding rather than CPC. When it drops back
below 0.8%, switch back to CPC.
● When bidding on CPM, bid the lowest end of the recommended bid if you’re
optimizing for cost. The problem, of course, is that the floor moves daily. So if you
don’t have a tool to adjust bids automatically, edit your ads in bulk once every
couple days.
● Test new ads by putting two into a campaign: The incumbent and the challenger.
If the challenger wins, put it into normal campaign rotation. This is required
because LinkedIn’s relevance score algorithm, which factors into how often your
ad is shown, heavily favors ad longevity.
○ If you don’t duplicate ads during the challenge faceoff, the old one
will always win.
Ad units
● Text ads
○ Good if you can only target desktop. Cheaper at $4-$6.
○ For imagery, use a face since that’s the only thing you can recognize at
that tiny size. Female faces perform best.
● Sponsored InMail
○ These aren’t a secret weapon, but they can work. What helps is that a
user on LinkedIn only receives up to one Sponsored InMail per 60 day
period.
○ These must feel very customized and relevant to the prospect , e.g.
“Because of who you are in {{industry}}, we wanted to give you this offer."
○ Make them as informal as possible. Like a message to a friend. No sales
fluff.
○ Every message should have an exploding timeline, e.g. if you’re putting on
a free event in their area, tell them it has to go into their cal or they’ll
inevitably forget it.
● Lead Form
○ If you have them working on Facebook, you can get them working on
LinkedIn. But they’re not otherwise a secret weapon.
○ CPL (Cost per Lead) will be lower than the regular gated funnel because
friction is lower by virtue of an embedded form, but these people will
ultimately convert worse down-funnel.
○ You can try pairing them with Sponsored InMail.
Retargeting
● LinkedIn can only track users back 90 days — compare this to Facebook’s 180
days.
● Tracking is cookie-based, which is a problem for all iOS devices that drop the
cookie after an in-app Safari session. (Different from using regular iOS Safari.)
● You can still fire conversion pixels — you just can’t retarget these users.
Direct targeting
● LinkedIn is surprisingly good at keeping an internal log of every user’s personal
and work emails (they can make the connection). So when doing retargeting, you
can actually rely on both, but generally personal emails will match better since
that’s what people mostly signup for LinkedIn with.
○ PeopleDataLabs' API is exceptional at matching business emails to
personal emails. So you can run your email list through their API and get a
list of personal emails to put into LinkedIn. Our community gets a huge
discount on their tool, email justin@peopledatalabs.com to learn more.
● You can use a tool like BuiltWith.com, Datanyze, or Clearbit.com to do lead gen
on companies who have certain technologies that your ideal prospects also use.
Tracking
● Make sure you have down-funnel conversion fully tracking for all new
registrations or email addresses.
● Because although LinkedIn CPA’s are very expensive, they tend to convert better
to paid. So you need to show the paper trail to prove this to clients when
spending their money on LinkedIn.
Saturation
● On LinkedIn, people don’t spend a lot of time casually browsing like they do on
Facebook. Therefore, ads don’t saturate as quickly.
● Although LinkedIn doesn’t report ad frequency, data shows CTR’s fall after
28-33 days. At this time, change images — since humans are good at ignoring
what they already recognize.

Project: LinkedIn Ads
A step-by-step guide on how to create LinkedIn ads.

Things to have beforehand
● Permissions: You must be an admin on your LinkedIn ad account and your
company page to create the type of ads we’ll be running — Direct Sponsored
Content. This is content that does not need to be published to the public
company page.
● Creatives (JPGs of the ads you want to put up). You made these in an earlier
module.
● Ad Copy
● LinkedIn conversion tracking installed
Phase 1: Initial setup
Head to https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ads, then click “Create Ad.”

Do any initial account setup you need to, then you should eventually end up at a screen
that says “Campaign Manager” on it. Make an ad account for your company if you
haven’t already.

Then, if you have the option, make a campaign group called “Default Campaign Group”.
Don’t set a budget, start it today, set the status as “Paused”, and let it run indefinitely.

Once you’ve created it, click on the name to open it up.

Phase 2: Audience generation
Click “Create Campaign.” Fill out as below (your default campaign group should say
“Paused” and not active - you'll see this if you click on the pencil icon in "Default
Campaign Group").

For "Objective", choose “Website conversions.”

You should now be in the Audience section.

Add in the locations you can target and the profile language.

Brainstorm audiences
We’re going to end up with a doc that looks like this. Skim it to get a sense of how it’s
organized.

Now open up the template and make a copy of it.

You’re going to come up with as many possible audiences as possible, as long as they
have over 50,000 people in them — anything less than that, and your audiences tend to
fatigue too quickly, and you’ll have too many people who don’t click on ads. You can
check this on the right with the “estimated target audience” section.

A few notes on this:

● Job Titles make up only ~40% of your audience.
○ Also, everyone targets by job title on LinkedIn. That’s LinkedIn’s strength.
But that makes targeting by job title more expensive.
○ So if you can figure out another way to target — for example, by job
function and seniority — you can often cut your costs because you can
target people that other advertisers aren’t going after.
● Job Function & Seniority - very broad, really high volume, and the
cheapest. Job function should the department someone sits in. You can
target Partners and Owners here.
● Skills & Seniority - broad, high volume, expensive.
○ You’ll catch people who get cute with their job titles: for example, CMOs
who go by "Chief Trash Can Officer". This happens more often than you’d
think.
○ Steal skills from someone in your target market who you’re already
connected with.
● Groups and Seniority - very precise, but low volume and $$.
● Make separate ad sets per seniority level, at minimum; break down by VP vs.
Director vs. Manager vs. C-Level, etc.
For Job Titles, if you’re targeting a title like “Marketing Director,” think up as many
permutations of it as possible. You can also pull from the job titles in the Multi-channel
ads proposal.

For example: “Marketing Director” is as good as “Director of Marketing”, “Head of
Marketing”, “VP of Marketing”, etc.

Add every permutation you can think of without overextending your audience.

For example: If you’re targeting senior engineers, don’t target “engineer” because
that would include civil and mechanical engineers, among others.

If you look beside the job title box, you can quickly click suggested job titles to add
them.

Add as many as you can until you’ve run out of ideas. The goal is to grow the
“estimated target audience” number on the right.

The above is just a start. You could have 20 times as many job titles.

Save your audience so you don’t have to re-input these job titles if you later target them
in a new campaign (trust us, it’s a pain). You can do so with this link at the bottom:

Name it accurately (e.g., “Industry: Fashion + Job Title: Marketing”). Save it.

Phase 3: Campaign creation
Make one campaign per audience segment. For example, if you’re selling
videoconferencing software, “Industry + Job Title: Tech + HR Director” would be a
different campaign from “Job Title: School Administrator”.

To create a campaign, click the button.

3a: Initial setup
Name the campaign name something like “Industry: Fashion + Job Title: Marketer,” or
whatever targeting criteria (Company Size, Industry, Job Title, etc.) makes sense.

Chose only one specific combination of criteria per campaign. For example, you don’t
target “Industries: Fashion + Technology + Job Title: Marketer.”

Select “Website visits.” Select your audience that you created in Phase 2.

Exclusion

Exclude all people who have visited your site in the past 90 days. Make that audience
list if it doesn’t already exist.

To do so:

Click "Exclude more":
Click "Matched audiences" -> "Add matched audience" -> "Create website
audiences":
Set it up this way:
Also exclude your own company and any current customers.
If you're targeting skills or groups, exclude using job function for anything that’s a
poor fit.
Next, disable Audience Expansion and LinkedIn Audience Network:
Checking these boxes allows LinkedIn to show our ads to people outside of the target
markets that we specified, making it harder to control our experiments and know what
works (it’s possible that we could have overlapping audiences).

Unless we’re really not reaching many people, leave the boxes unchecked.

3b: Ad format
Select Single image ad, Carousel image ad, or Video ad (depending on which you want
to start with) for the Ad Format. These are all Sponsored Content formats. Note: you'll
need to make one campaign for each type of ad (i.e. one for video ads, one for single
image ads, etc.).

3c: Set budget and schedule
Select "Set both a daily and total budget."

Because you’ll be experimenting with ads to start, base your daily budget on the
following formula:

● Take your acceptable CAC
● Multiply it by 3 (giving us room to optimize)
● Divide by 7 (so we can run ads for a week, in case people convert worse on a
Tuesday as opposed to a Sunday)
If you’re just starting to test this ad group, set the total budget as 3x your acceptable
CAC.

Why set a total budget? Do it in case you make a typo somewhere or forget to turn off
ads. This prevents runaway spend.

Select "Automated Bid" for bid type.

3d: Create tracking URL
Follow the UTM guidelines from our tracking template and use the URL builder linked
inside.

On LinkedIn, paste the URL into where it says "Enter in your landing page URL."

Then immediately delete it once the UI changes. (You’ll see some extra fields pop
up.) The link will still be there when a user clicks the ad, but we need to have real copy
there instead of a URL.

Yes. The UI can improve.

Phase 4: Create sponsored content
4a: Name it
Click "Create new ad."

Name your ad “#{Target Audience} — #{Creative Name} — #{Optional Criteria}”.

Example: “NYC — Event Space #1 — Rent Gorgeous NYC event space
w/Bullets”

4d: Ad copy
Then, use that space to write the copy for the text that appears above the ad. Pull this
from the social ad copy you made.

For example:

Rent gorgeous NYC event space:• Launch a product or throw an event• Access
coveted local real estate

Fill out the Ad Headline section, then duplicate the headline into the “Ad Description”
section (very few LinkedIn users see the Ad Description).

4a: Add image
Click the pencil icon and upload your image.Add a call to action. (Use "Learn More" for
prospecting ads.)

Your final product should look something like this:

Uncheck "add to campaign."

Hit "Create."

4f: Make all your ads for the campaign at once
If you try to make one ad at a time, you’ll sometimes run into an error message. Make
sure you create all your sponsored content, then click "Browse existing content" and
select all of the ads, and hit “Sponsor” for the smoothest experience.

Note that you’ll end up making new ads for multiple campaigns even if the copy and
creative (the JPG) are the same — the tracking URL needs to be different.

Once you’ve created the ads, check all the ads you want to include in the campaign,
then click "Sponsor."

Side Note -- The convoluted Linkedin-esque way to delete an ad:

To delete a sponsored content, the campaign and ad first has to be active. Then, from
the dashboard, navigate to the Ads tab of the campaign, and locate the ad you want to
delete. Click on it so you get its preview. From the newsfeed, click the 3 dots for more
options and there it is: the obscure way to delete the ad.

Phase 5: Make your other ad sets
Your other audiences need loving too.

Then, if your product can only be used on desktop, you can experiment with LinkedIn
Text Ads — an ad type that only shows up on LinkedIn’s desktop version. Go through
phases 1-4, but when you make a new campaign, for the ad format select “Text Ads”
instead of image/carousel/video.

Phase 6: Self Review
Run through the LinkedIn Checklist to make sure you didn’t miss anything.

Save the campaign as a draft.

Phase 7: Launch
Set every campaign as “Active”.

Phase 8: Optimize
Set a calendar event to review ad performance (see Ad Optimization > Project: How to
Read Ad Results and Optimize Ads) in 1, 4, and 7 days.

Go forth and optimize, young marketer.

What is content marketing?
Content marketing is the creation and use of content to grow your business. Though
often thought of in terms of blogging, it includes many different content formats, like:

● Ebooks
● Videos
● Newsletters
● Podcasts
● White papers
● Slide decks
● Infographics
● Quizzes
Content marketing is used across the entire funnel—for generating brand awareness,
improving sales enablement, and more—but we’ll focus on how to use it to get more
customers.

Two important parts of content marketing:

Creation: Producing content—usually either through an editorial team or people
who use your product
Distribution: Sharing content with a wider audience through owned, acquired,
and organic channels. We’ll only cover owned and acquired distribution in this
chapter.
Why learn content marketing
When successful, content marketing can:

● Drive consistent, ongoing traffic and leads: Content captures your audience’s
attention and gets them interested in your brand. The more satisfied visitors are
with your content, the more likely they’ll convert into paying customers and share
your content with their networks.
● Develop brand reputation and authority: Content alone can improve visibility
of your brand, and good content enhances its credibility. It establishes your
company as a leader and gives potential customers confidence about your
product.
● Generate compounding results: The content that you create today can drive
traffic and leads for months, even years, to come. This is especially true for
“evergreen” content, content that remains relevant over a long period of time.
Who should use content marketing
Most companies can benefit from content marketing.

Why? Besides getting more visitors to your site, content also helps grow direct
sales—so you won’t have to spend as much time pitching your products to potential
customers.

Most niches are already saturated with content, though, making it hard for any business
to jump in. That said, the companies with the most content marketing potential usually
have:

● A dedicated marketer: This person understands that it’s not enough to go
through the motions of creating and publishing content. They’re strategic and
want to try new things for better results.
● A long time frame for returns: They understand that content-driven growth is a
long-term play and aren’t rushed for results.
Is content marketing right for my
business?
Content marketing can help sell all kinds of products, but it’s especially helpful for
selling new or innovative products that need more explaining.

Example : Service

Service is an app that helps travelers get compensated for unexpected flight delays and
cancellations. Knowing that their product can raise a lot of questions, Service’s team
created a 30-second video to explain how it works.

Compared to a traditional cold call, this video is faster at describing a product and more
visually appealing.

Example : Pillow Cube

Pillow Cube sells square-shaped foam pillows, something that doesn’t seem very
appealing without context.

Knowing how unusual their product looks, the Pillow Cube team created a 95-second
video to explain why their pillows are shaped that way.

Content marketing is especially effective for B2B SaaS companies because compared
to ecommerce brands, B2B SaaS products are usually more complex and harder to sell.

For example, it’s harder to explain the benefits of a new accounting software than it is to
describe the benefits of a calculator. But content marketing can convey this information
in a more easily digestible way.

Watch how QuickBooks uses a 90-second video to explain its software. It’s faster and
more visually appealing than describing these benefits through a traditional cold call.

Just because a piece of content can work better than a cold call doesn’t mean content
marketing is right for every company. To see if it makes sense for your brand, we’ve
developed a simple framework based on five variables.

Ideal conditions for content marketing

● Low constraints (faces few obstacles)
● High resources (has access to many resources)
● High time to results (can wait at least six months before seeing results)
● Low-moderate competition (exists in a niche or uncompetitive market)
● High consumption behavior (audience actively consumes content before making
purchase decisions)
If at least three of these conditions apply to your company, content marketing can
work.

But if only two or less apply, other growth channels might be a better fit.

Important note: Our framework isn’t definitive. It’s a rule of thumb, but there are
companies that make content work without checking three out of five boxes.

Here’s an example. Although it usually takes a few months before seeing any content
marketing results, it’s also possible to see progress within a shorter amount of time. This
might happen if:

● Your brand already has an audience (email subscribers or social media
followers).
● Your content strategy focuses on creating and distributing content to current
customers.
● You're in an emerging category with minimal competition.
In these cases, you may see content marketing results in less time than if you were
building an audience from the ground up.

3 Content Marketing Strategies
There isn’t a “right” way to do content marketing—but we’ve identified three approaches
for sustainable content-driven growth:

Editorial/search engine optimization (SEO)
Editorial/virality
User-generated content (UGC)
These approaches differ in who creates the content and how it’s distributed, but there’s
one common theme across them:

Great content provides great value.

Whether that value is useful information, entertainment, or something else, it’s what
ultimately helps content creators achieve their marketing goals.

Below, we’ll describe each approach in more detail.

Editorial/SEO
Using this approach, a brand creates content with the goal for it to rank well in search
results. The content creator may be the founder, in-house marketer, or an outsourced
expert.

This strategy is data-driven and focuses on generating organic traffic through search
engine optimization (SEO). It’s easier to find topics because of keyword research, which
helps brands decide what topics they should create content about.

With editorial/SEO content, you should expect a minimum of 6 months before seeing
any jumps in traffic and leads. (But this time frame could be shorter for websites with a
longer history and existing relationships.)

Below are two B2C examples of editorial/SEO-focused content, which we’ll discuss in
more detail later on:

● Rover.com publishes educational content for dog owners on its blog and
YouTube channel.
● Skillshare creates keyword-optimized tutorials and guides for people interested in
starting a new creative hobby.
As well as a couple examples from B2B companies:

● Ahrefs educates viewers in SEO and digital marketing on its blog and YouTube
channel.
● CoSchedule offers free downloadable resources on its blog.
Editorial/virality
Like the editorial/SEO approach, a company creates content for itself in this strategy.
However, its main goal is to create content that’s widely shared rather than content that
ranks highly in search results.

Content in this strategy focuses on grabbing users’ attention and delivering high-quality
information and new ideas. It also tends to stir emotion in some way. It also resonates
with audiences in some way, compelling them to share it with others via email, Twitter,
etc.

This strategy’s biggest challenge is the creativity required of it. There’s no formula for
creating viral content, and there’s also no predictable time frame for seeing results.
Some brands chase virality for years before finding success.

Below are two B2C examples of editorial/virality-focused content, which we’ll discuss in
more detail later on:

● Zillow created fictional property listings for famous characters that people love,
like Santa’s home and the Incredibles’ super-home.
● Course Hero commissioned helpful infographics about famous pieces of
literature, which are shared widely by teachers and students.
Two ecommerce examples:

● Beardbrand creates attention-grabbing videos about men’s hair and beard
transformations on YouTube.
● BARK relies on in-house writers and freelancers to create entertaining
dog-themed articles on its content site BarkPost.
And a couple from B2B companies:

● Priceonomics publishes blog posts with titles like “Diamonds Are Bullshit” and
“What It's Like to Fail.”
● Mailchimp created unusual, attention-grabbing mini campaigns for nine fake
brands.
User-generated content (UGC)
Unlike the other two approaches, user-generated content (UGC) relies on a company’s
users to create content. This can happen organically or be encouraged by a brand.
Companies then leverage the UGC for their marketing campaigns.

UGC may be optimized for search or sharing. Users typically create content when they
have a strong emotional reaction to a company, e.g., writing a product review after
receiving poor service.

This strategy is challenging because UGC is mostly up to a company’s customers,
although brands can encourage or incentivize users to create content.

Below are two examples of UGC strategies from B2C brands, which we’ll discuss in
more detail later on:

● Yelp incentivizes users to leave business reviews, which rank highly in search
results.
● Adobe uses branded hashtag campaigns on social media to show off
user-created digital projects.
And two ecommerce examples:

● Casper uses customer reviews to optimize its website for review-related
keywords.
● GoPro repurposes camera footage from its customers for its blog, YouTube
channel, and social media accounts.
Plus two B2B examples:

● Adobe uses branded hashtag campaigns on social media to show off
user-created digital projects
● G2 incentivizes users to review software products on its marketplace and review
site
Important note
The three approaches described above are all proven content marketing strategies, but
UGC tends to be more product-dependent than editorial content strategies. Because of
this, our program will focus more on editorial SEO and virality.

There are also more approaches to content marketing than those listed above. For
example, some companies use product-centered content (like user guides) to improve
customer retention. However, for our growth program, we’ll focus on using content for
acquisition.

How to Determine Which Strategy to Use
The three content marketing strategies we’ve outlined aren’t mutually exclusive, but
you’ll increase your chances of success by focusing on just one. Trying to tackle more
than one at a time will spread your efforts thinly, reducing potential gains.

To decide which strategy is best for your company, start by answering these two
questions:

● What kind of content would your potential customers be most interested in?
● What kind of content can naturally segue into a pitch for your product?
From there, you can decide which strategy is appropriate.

We’ve also developed a framework to help:

Search interest: Is there high search volume for your product?
Product shareability: Do users find your product shareworthy?
User content: Do users create content using your product?
Data and research: Does your brand have access to proprietary data?
Alternatively, does it conduct industry research?
Emotional appeal: Does your product or brand create a strong emotional
impact?
Thought leadership: Do you or your team have lots of industry expertise to
share?
Based on our observations, here’s how most successful B2C companies use these
factors to choose a content strategy:

● Moderate to high
search interest
● Strong thought

Example: A lot of people

Example: People use

Let's also take a look at how the framework applies to B2B companies:

Editorial/SEO Editorial/Virality UGC
● Moderate to high
search interest

Example: A lot of people
search online for SEO tips

● Users naturally

Example: People use

and create art. Adobe

media.
More on each part of our framework below.

Search interest
You can tell how much interest there is in a topic by how often people search for it in
Google, which is measured as monthly search volume. The higher the search volume
of a specific keyword, the more interest there is—and usually, the harder it is to create
high-ranking content about it.

Keyword research tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, and Ubersuggest provide data about
search interest. You can also use Google Trends to track real-time search interest.

What counts as “high” search interest? Here’s a breakdown of how we classify
keywords based on search volume.

● High: More than 1,000 searches per month
● Moderate: Between 100 and 1,000 searches per month
● Low: Under 100 searches per month
● Nonexistent: No search volume exists for these highly niche phrases
Note: A low search volume for keywords doesn’t rule out SEO potential. A low search
volume may instead mean that you’re in a very specific niche with less competition—a
big SEO advantage.

But if your product is so novel that no one’s searching for it, SEO probably isn’t a good
investment. The lack of search interest may mean it’s better to shoot for virality.

Product shareability
Shareability describes how “shareworthy” something is. It’s what makes customers
decide to share something with their friends, and it’s usually more common in
ecommerce. (Things that can be photographed or recorded are easier to share.)

But some software products are shareable because of a unique design or innovative
use. Examples: Dropbox and Evernote were highly shareable when they first launched
because of their novelty at the time.

When a product is more shareable, it usually has more potential for creating viral
content.

User content
Some companies naturally encourage users to create content as a part of their product
experience—for example, people write book reviews on Goodreads, create graphics in
Canva, and record video in Loom.

Since this content can be repurposed for marketing campaigns, these companies have
an advantage in UGC strategies. Otherwise, companies must work on getting users to
create content.

Data and research
Some companies have exclusive access to data. Example: Zillow has data about all of
the properties listed on its platform. This information is a goldmine that can be
repurposed into meaningful content.

Similarly, if your company conducts research, it can use this information for content
marketing. The robo-investing platform Wealthfront does this by publishing research
reports on investing and personal finance.

Emotional appeal
You can put an emotional spin on just about any product, but some products carry more
emotional appeal than others. This may be because of the product’s purpose or if your
brand has a unique mission. Whatever the reason, a product with more emotional
appeal lends well to viral content campaigns.

Example: The guided meditation app Headspace’s mission is to improve customers’
health and happiness. It makes a case for mindfulness to appeal to anyone feeling
stressed and overwhelmed.

Thought leadership
Many companies share their expertise to build their brand reputation, usually in niches
where customers ask a lot of questions. Example: Duolingo publishes articles about
language learning from its team of learning scientists.

Strong thought leadership and expertise on your team sets your brand up for editorial
content strategies. You can use this in-house knowledge to create top-notch content,
either for SEO or more shares.

Additional considerations
Besides the factors above, also consider these three questions to decide which strategy
is best for your company:

Which strategy can I realistically produce quality content for? Think about
your time, money, and bandwidth. Some types of content are more
resource-intensive than others; for example, producing excellent videos usually
requires quality software and expertise.
Which strategy can I consistently produce quality content for? Content is a
game of consistency. It's impossible to scale a company off the backs of just a
couple great pieces of content. This can work to get initial traction, but if your
goal is long-term growth then be sure you can put out great content consistently.
How will I differentiate my content? Since many industries are saturated with
content, you’ll need to find ways to make yours stand out.
How do my target users consume content? Think about your target
audience—their favorite content channels and formats—and how you can create
content that matches these preferences.
Remember to focus on one content marketing strategy at a time. Mastery in one area
will go much further than dividing your attention across multiple channels.

Editorial/SEO
Editorial/SEO strategies take a data-driven approach to content: brands choose topics
to create content about based on search trends and user behavior.

Below, we’ll focus mostly on creating text-based content for Google, but many tactics
apply to other content formats. For more technical on-page and off-page optimization
strategies, we advise going through our SEO unit.

What does excellent editorial/SEO
content look like?
Content in this strategy is usually:

● More educational than promotional: Users search because they want
information. Editorial/SEO content satisfies this by giving information on topics
people care about.
● Easy to consume: If content is hard to read or understand, chances are a user
will leave a site very quickly—bad for SEO because Google looks at user
experience signals to understand content quality.
● Original: Many articles paraphrase existing content with few original
contributions. But involving true subject matter experts makes content more
valuable and helps it earn shares and backlinks. (Websites with more quality
backlinks, or links from another website, usually perform better in search results.)
Some so-called SEO experts claim a few easy tricks as the key to higher search
rankings. According to them:

● Long-form content ranks better than short-form content.
● Keyword density—the number of times a keyword appears in a piece of
content—matters.
● Conceptually related keywords matter.
These are myths. There are no shortcuts to better rankings, although Google’s
Webmaster guidelines do offer a list of bad optimization techniques to avoid. The main
gist behind them: avoid creating any content that doesn’t actually help the user.

How to create excellent content
Google’s ranking factors are always changing. In spite of this, we’ve identified seven
tactics that help drive SEO success:

Use keyword research to guide content creation.
Choose keywords based on relevance and intent.
Categorize keyword data into topic clusters.
Target a mix of keywords.
Establish editorial consistency.
Optimize content for user experience.
Focus on content depth.
We’ll discuss each in more detail below.

Use keyword research to guide content creation.
Companies do keyword research to find out topics that users are interested in.

Two important pieces of info during this process:

Search volume: The average number of searches for a topic within a certain
time frame, usually a month. This number changes over time.
Difficulty: How hard it is to create content that ranks for a specific keyword. This
is also known as keyword competition.
SEO tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, and Moz can help identify keywords worth targeting
based on search volume and difficulty.

You can also gauge the difficulty of a keyword by looking at the first page of its search
results. Three rules of thumb:

The higher the total number of results, the more difficult a keyword phrase tends
to be.
If there are ads at the top of search results, the keyword phrase is harder to rank
for.
If Reddit posts and Quora questions appear on the first page of search results,
chances are the topic isn’t very competitive. Very targeted landing pages usually
appear for the most difficult topics.
Choose keywords based on relevance and intent.
Search volume and difficulty are a good starting point for deciding which keywords to
create content about. However, you should also consider keyword relevance and search
intent.

● Relevance: How closely a specific keyword or topic relates to your product
● Search intent: The user’s purpose behind a specific query. There are four types:
○ Informational: The user searches for content because they’re looking for
information about a subject, e.g., your industry, the problem your product
solves, the benefits of solving it, etc.
○ Commercial investigation: The user isn’t ready to make a purchase yet
but is looking for content to help get there, e.g., product reviews and
comparison guides.
○ Transactional: The user is ready to make a purchase. Sales pages with
contact forms are best for this intent.
○ Navigational: The user searches to get to a specific website, e.g.,
searching a company’s name to find its website or YouTube channel.
Categorize your keyword data based on relevance (high, medium, low) and search
intent. For new companies, it’s best to prioritize keywords with high relevance and either
informational or commercial investigation intent.

Content that targets these keyword phrases has a better chance of bringing in visitors
that will actually benefit from your product.

Categorize keyword data into topic clusters.
As you go through your keyword data, you’ll probably notice very similar phrases. Since
users search for topics using different wording, some phrases are variations with the
same intent. In these cases, a single piece of content can target all of them.

Here’s how to organize your keyword data into topic clusters:

Group related keywords. Keywords belong in the same cluster if the intent behind
them is identical or very similar.
In each cluster, identify the primary keyword. This keyword is the overarching
theme of the cluster, and is usually the keyword with the highest search volume.
For the other keywords, categorize them as secondary and tertiary keywords.
These are the keywords that relate to the primary one but have lower search
volume and relevance.
For example, check out this topic cluster about sending money abroad:

Keyword Monthly Search
Volume
Send money abroad 590
How can I send money internationally 210
How to send money abroad 170
How to send money abroad without fees 20
How long does it take to send money
abroad
20
Based on this data, it makes sense to create content targeting “send money abroad” as
your primary keyword. Related keywords like “how to send money abroad without fees”
and “how long does it take to send money abroad” are less popular but still relevant, so
they should be secondary/tertiary keywords.

Target a mix of keywords.
Marketers typically target either keywords with high search volume or keywords with low
difficulty.

It’s hard to find keywords that fit both—aka popular keywords (high search volume) that
aren’t competitive (low difficulty). This usually happens with new, trending topics, which
quickly become more difficult to rank for as people rush to create content.

We don’t advise either strategy because:

● Keywords with high search volume tend to be more competitive. These are
the popular queries with thousands of searches per month. More companies
target them, making it hard for new websites to create content that ranks.
● Keywords with low difficulty tend to be more niche phrases. Fewer brands
target them because interest in these topics tends to be lower.
Instead, target a mix of keywords for a more balanced SEO strategy.

Establish editorial consistency.
Your content is more likely to succeed if you set some editorial standards.

Three places you need consistency:

● Branding: Your company’s voice, tone, and style
● Quality: Your writing’s structure, detail, and accuracy
● Publishing: When your content is scheduled
Your publishing schedule depends on how often you can create content that meets
these standards. Having a set schedule helps to develop a loyal following, but you
should never publish content at the expense of quality.

Some people believe that the more often they publish content, the better—but this big
misconception downplays content quality. If you trade quality for frequency, your content
is more likely to be mediocre.

Optimize content for user experience.
The more user-friendly your content, the longer users will stick around.

To make content more user-friendly:

Answer your target keyword’s intent. Place the most important information
toward the beginning of your content. Visitors shouldn’t need to go back to
Google’s search results after reading your content.
Link to reputable resources. Don’t direct users to sites with malware or
inaccurate information.
Focus on readability. Break up your content with headings, numbered/bullet
lists, and line breaks. If it’s a long piece of content, include a table of contents.
Also use images and videos to support your key points.
Make your website easy to navigate. Use a clear navigation menu and link
internally within your content. Also incorporate a search bar for users’
convenience.
Use a responsive design. A responsive web design automatically adjusts to
screen size so that users can enjoy a page’s content regardless of what type of
device they use.
Improve page speed. The faster your page speed, the better—Google’s bots will
be able to index more pages and users won’t leave impatiently. Analyze your
content’s current load time with Google’s PageSpeed Insights.
Focus on content depth first.
No matter your niche size, we recommend creating content on a very narrow scope of
topics early on.

For instance, instead of creating content about learning a new language, hone in on
learning Spanish specifically. Use Answer the Public to find the most common questions
being asked about your topic. Then focus on answering them thoroughly.

There are two advantages to this:

There are more interlinking opportunities. It’s easier to link internally between
highly related content on your site than content that relates only peripherally. This
matters because internal links make it easy for both users and search engine
crawlers to navigate around a site.
You’ll become the authority for a specific niche faster. Covering every angle
of Topic X gives you more credibility than if you shallowly covered Topics X, Y,
and Z. You’ll be a specialist rather than a jack of all trades.
Once you’ve fully covered a topic, branch into related ones. The key is identifying topics
that are highly relevant to your product.

How to optimize your results
Success with this strategy requires continued focus on your content and industry, plus
SEO.

For better results:

● Conduct content audits. Review your content’s performance regularly to find
out which pieces of content have moved in search rankings. Also find out what
new keywords your content ranks for and what keywords it’s lost.
● Revisit old content. Updating old content can have better ROI than creating
new content—so make an action plan for older content based on your audit.
Potential changes include:
○ Fixing broken links and typos
○ Adding new information, links, images, videos, or other relevant content
○ Deleting outdated, irrelevant, or redundant content
○ Rewriting for more clarity
○ Consolidating content from different pages
● Monitor your industry. Your industry is a good source for new, relevant topics to
create content about. Follow the news about what’s going on and keep tabs on
your competitors.
● Stay up-to-date on SEO news. Subscribe to authority publications about SEO,
like Search Engine Journal and Search Engine Land, and follow Google’s Search
Liaison on Twitter.
Examples of effective editorial/SEO
content
Rover.com
The dog boarding and walking app Rover.com creates optimized content for its blog and
YouTube channel.

According to Semrush, its website ranks for more than 775,000 keywords, including:

● dogs that don’t shed (90,500 searches per month)
● can dogs eat popcorn (40,500 searches per month)
● eye drops for dogs (14,800 searches per month)
A lot of this content is helpful and educational, with the goal of answering new dog
owners’ questions about their pets. This is the same on Rover.com’s YouTube channel,
which has more than 1.1 million views and videos like “How to Measure Your Dog for
Clothing.”

Chances are that anyone looking for advice on caring for a dog will come across
Rover.com’s content, either on its blog or YouTube, because of how keyword-targeted it
is.

Skillshare
Many people who want to pick up a new creative hobby first turn to Google for answers.
The learning platform Skillshare capitalizes on this by creating educational blog posts
about art and design, all optimized for the most popular search queries.

For example, here are the titles of a few of its top-ranking posts and what they rank for:

● “The 9 Best Animation Software for Beginners and Beyond” – ranks for
“animation software”
● “The Narrative Technique Guide: 25 Examples and Explanations That’ll Make
You a Better Reader and Writer” – ranks for “narrative techniques”
● “85 Very Adorable, Cute & Easy Drawings to Make” – ranks for “cute simple
drawings”
The result: Skillshare’s site ranks for more than 31,000 keywords related to painting,
cinematography, and many more creative activities. And by targeting these keywords,
Skillshare reaches more of its target clientele—people interested in developing their
skills in creative subjects.

Fitbit
Many people who want to start getting into shape first turn to Google for answers. Fitbit
capitalizes on this by creating educational blog posts about fitness and health, all
optimized for the most popular search queries.

According to Semrush, Fitbit’s blog ranks for more than 62,400 keywords, including:

● weight loss meal plan (49,500 searches per month)
● high protein breakfast (27,100 searches per month)
● medicine ball exercises (8,100 searches per month)
Chances are that anyone looking for health and wellness information will come across
Fitbit’s content. By targeting these keywords, Fitbit establishes its brand as an authority
in the health and fitness niche—and it makes a stronger case for why people should try
out its product.

Stitch Fix
Like health and fitness, fashion is a topic that many people search for answers to online,
especially when it comes to making style decisions.

To get in front of these users, Stitch Fix focuses its content strategy on SEO. Although it
publishes a few topical posts (e.g., “Women’s Summer 2021 Fashion Trends: Your
Guide”), most of its blog is optimized around providing evergreen fashion tips and
answering styling questions.

For example, here are the titles of a few of its top-ranking posts and what they rank for:

● “Men’s Wedding Guest Outfits” – ranks for “mens wedding guest outfit”
● “How to Dress For Any Graduation” – ranks for “what to wear to a graduation”
● “Semi-Formal Wedding Attire For Men: A Complete Guide” – ranks for “semi
formal wedding attire”
The result: Stitch Fix’s blog ranks for more than 87,000 keywords related to fashion.
And by targeting these keywords, Stitch Fix reaches more of its target clientele—people
who aren’t so knowledgeable about fashion and would maybe rather use a styling
service.

Ahrefs
Ahrefs’ content marketing strategy revolves around creating optimized content for its
blog and YouTube channel.

According to Semrush, its website ranks for more than 78,000 keywords, including:

● affiliate marketing (74,000 searches per month)
● google keyword planner (40,500 searches per month)
● backlinks (8,100 searches per month)
Ahrefs’ YouTube channel also has more than 10 million views and 218,000 subscribers,
with videos showing on the first page for searches about SEO.

Chances are that anyone looking for SEO and digital marketing tutorials will come
across Ahrefs’ content because of its excellent optimization.

Coschedule
According to Semrush, CoSchedule’s site ranks for more than 77,000 keywords, the
majority of which are for CoSchedule’s blog posts.

Some of these posts feature lead magnets —pieces of content that readers can access
if they fill out a form.

One example: CoSchedule’s social media content calendar template. Users just need to
provide their name, email, and company information to get it.

The page ranks highly for 693 organic keywords, including:

● social media calendar (6,600 searches per month)
● social media content calendar (3,600 searches per month)
● social media calendar template (3,600 searches per month)
● social media content calendar template (1,300 searches per month)
The best part: social media calendars relate to CoSchedule’s product, a calendar
software. So someone searching for a social media calendar is probably a great
candidate to try out CoSchedule—and coming across its blog post leads them there.

Editorial/Virality
This content approach relies on commissioning in-house employees or contractors to
create content that people want to share with others.

What does excellent content look like?
There’s no way to guarantee that a piece of content will go viral, but we’ve found that
most successful content in this strategy tends to be:

● Novel: It presents a fresh idea or a new angle on a familiar topic.
● Emotional: It elicits strong feelings—positive or negative—from the consumer.
How to create excellent content
The word “viral” is often used to describe short videos, catchy memes, and shocking
news. However, virality doesn’t just come in one style or format; anything can go viral.

You can increase your chances of virality through these seven tactics:

Focus on one channel.
Reverse engineer the most shared content in your industry.
Leverage company data.
Pinpoint the exact who and why behind sharing.
Develop a compelling headline.
Optimize content for shareability.
Create content authentic to your brand identity.
Focus on one channel.
Focusing on just one channel can help you create more targeted content, like what kind
of format to use. For example, it wouldn’t make sense to write a lot of text for Instagram
or TikTok.

Choose a channel based on your target audience—where do they usually consume
content? You can repurpose content for other channels later on, but for now, pick one as
a launchpad. (We’ll also cover more about each channel in our distribution section.)

Reverse engineer popular content in your industry.
Once you’ve decided which channel to focus on, take a look at what currently performs
well. Use BuzzSumo or a similar tool to identify the most shared or upvoted pieces of
content.

Then run each piece of content through these questions:

How was it formatted?
What emotion(s) did it evoke?
What separates it from similar ones that didn’t go viral?
Who shared/upvoted the content? Did any influencers share it?
When was it published? (Beyond time and date, consider the larger context of
when it was published.)
How could the content be improved?
Look for trends, and then use your observations as a framework for your own content.

Leverage company data.
The data generated by your company is a good source for content ideas that might go
viral. Why? It’s exclusive to your company; no other business has that information.

The challenge here: transforming your data into an interesting narrative that people
want to share.

Example : OkCupid

OkCupid often uses its own platform data to create blog posts that people share and
major media outlets quote or link to. Here’s one such article.

Example : LinkedIn

LinkedIn wrote about the most in-demand skills in 2020 and gave employers tips on
how to get better candidates. The article was shared more than 19,000 times across
Facebook.

No matter your industry, your data can be interesting. Look for ways to relate it to your
audience.

Pinpoint the exact who and why behind sharing.
Two important questions to improve the odds of your content going viral:

Who would most likely share it?
Why would they share it?
The more specific your answer, the better. Understanding your audience is the core of
virality—without people, content can’t be shared.

Why do people even share content in the first place? It’s a form of self-expression—how
someone projects their identity.

The most relevant motivations include:

● Status: How does this content elevate the sharer’s status?
● Identity: How does this content reflect who the sharer is?
● Being helpful: Does this content benefit the sharer’s network?
● Novelty: What new, interesting, or entertaining idea does this content present?
Home in on the exact reason why a user might share your content. If you can’t pinpoint
this why, your idea probably needs more refining.

Develop a compelling headline.
Content becomes viral because people decide it’s worthy of being shared. But half the
battle of getting users to share content is getting them to click on it in the first place.
That’s why headlines are a big deal for going viral—they impact whether users decide to
read something on their newsfeed.

According to research on virality, the B2C headlines that are most likely to drive
engagement:

● Stir emotion: “The Investment Advice That Could Change Your Financial Life”
● Create urgency: “These Popular Android Apps Are Putting User Data at Risk”
● Offer a solution or explanation: “Understanding Crypto: We Explain Bitcoin
Lingo for Those Crypto Noobs”
● Use numbers: “The 50 Best TV Shows to Binge-Watch Tonight”
The top ecommerce headlines are:

● Stir emotion: “41 Cleaning Products So Effective You Might Want To Cry From
Relief”
● Create urgency: “You’re Missing Out on Two Amazing Kitchen Gadgets”
● Offer a solution or explanation: “What is Kombucha? All Your Questions
Answered”
● Use numbers: “12 Wardrobe Essentials For Every Woman”
While the top B2B headlines are:

● Explicitly describe what a piece of content is about: “62.41% of All Google
Searches Generate 0 Clicks”
● Offer an explanation or actionable advice: “Ecommerce SEO: A Simple (But
Complete) Guide”
● Relate to industry news: “How Intel and Burger King built an order
recommendation system that preserves customer privacy”
● Use numbers: “18 Examples of Brilliant Email Marketing Campaigns”
● Include brackets for clarification: “Ecommerce Business Ideas in 2020 [27
Industry Experts]”
Consider why your audience should care about your content, and create a title based
around this reason. Note that “compelling” doesn’t mean clickbait—avoid creating any
titles that trick or mislead readers. You can test this by asking, “Would I be disappointed
to see this piece of content based on the title?”

Optimize content for shareability.
If content can’t be shared easily, it probably won’t go viral.

To make content more shareable:

● Focus on a single message. Avoid tackling too many topics within one piece of
content. Commit to one message; then get to the point quickly.
● Place social share buttons prominently so content is easier to share.
Embed them above the fold (the part of a web page that’s immediately visible
before scrolling); repeat them at the bottom of a post; or make them float
alongside the content regardless of scrolling.
● Make content that’s easy to consume. Order your content logically and avoid
using a lot of jargon. For text-based content, use headings, lists, and line breaks.
● Set a descriptive featured image for your content. Your content’s featured
image is like a sneak peek of your content. Choose an appealing image to get
more users to check it out.
Create content authentic to your brand identity.
Look at existing viral content for inspiration—but don’t try to copy it if it doesn’t fit your
brand’s mission, voice, and values.

For example, some brands, like Netflix and Groupon, use humor successfully in their
content to get virality. That doesn’t mean it’s a must for yours.

How to optimize your results
There may be trends in what makes some pieces of content go viral—but still, achieving
virality is more art than science.

Part of why there’s no foolproof formula for virality is the fact that it usually reflects the
culture and trends of a specific point in time—which are always changing. So a viral
piece of content from 10 years ago might not go viral today because of changes in
people’s ideas of what’s worth sharing.

Although there’s no easy answer to virality, you can increase its likelihood through
repeated effort. Think of creativity as a muscle. To exercise it, you should:

● Monitor news and trending topics. Pay attention to news where your brand
can make an interesting contribution.
● Study the latest viral content in your industry and from your competitors.
Some great places to start: TLDR and Not Boring. Continue to reverse engineer
the content that’s popular with your target audience, and look for ways to improve
it.
● Experiment with your content. Test new approaches and ideas. Analyze your
results, and apply new learnings to future pieces of content. For example, rewrite
headlines and reshare your content at different times.
Examples of effective editorial/viral
content
Zillow
The real estate marketplace Zillow has enough resources to invest in all kinds of
content marketing, including creative content with the goal of getting lots of shares. For
example, it’s created property listings for Santa’s home and the Incredibles’
super-home.

Zillow’s team even created press releases to get more eyes on these listings.

These fictional property listings aren’t meant to be optimized for SEO—they’re for
entertainment. Anyone who likes Christmas or Pixar might share them for fun, placing
Zillow’s brand in front of more people.

Course Hero
The online learning platform Course Hero commissions infographics as a key part of its
content marketing strategy. There are more than 500 infographics, each of which
summarizes a famous piece of literature.

Free for anyone to use, the infographics are especially useful for Course Hero’s target
audience: teachers and students.

Because of their visual format, the infographics have been shared on Pinterest more
than 253,000 times. Even better, they lead more new traffic to Course Hero’s website
and other resources, like study guides for each famous book.

Beardbrand
The men’s grooming company Beardbrand is known for reinventing its market with its
strong content marketing. It did this by taking a new angle on its target customers and
creating fresh content to appeal to what it called the “urban beardsman”—not the
hippies, lumberjacks, or other stereotypes often associated with beards.

You can find this content on Beardbrand’s YouTube channel, which has more than 1.7
million subscribers. Some of its most popular videos are hair and beard transformations,
which receive millions of views and thousands of comments.

The videos aren’t optimized for popular keywords—instead, they’re meant to be
entertaining and grab the attention of those who fit Beardbrand’s target audience.

BARK
BARK, the company behind dog-themed subscription service BarkBox, focuses on
creating viral content to appeal to dog owners.

Early on, its writers focused mostly on targeting keywords to create educational
content—topics like “how to trim your dog’s toenails.” But noticing that few other pet
brands were being silly at the time, the team decided to take a more personable
approach to content.

So they created the content site BarkPost, which publishes mostly entertaining articles
about dogs. Take a look at some of its slideshow titles.

Finding humor in everyday dog antics is something that many dog owners can relate
to—and something that they’d find shareworthy. Many of BarkPost’s articles regularly
get thousands of shares on Facebook, Pinterest, and other social media networks, as
well as mentions and links from major media outlets like HuffPost, USA Today, and
PBS.

Priceonomics’ blog
Priceonomics started out as a price guide for buying and selling used items, but over
time, became known for its viral blog posts. On average, its blog posts each get 25,000
views. Here are the titles of a few of the most popular:

● “Diamonds Are Bullshit”
● “What It's Like to Fail”
● “The San Francisco Rent Explosion”
● “How Photography Was Optimized for White Skin Color”
Priceonomics’ content writers don’t care about whether their blog posts rank #1 in
search results. Instead, they want to create content that people find interesting and
worth sharing—which is why their blog post titles are written in such an intriguing way.

Priceonomics’ posts don't go viral just because of their title, though. The writers optimize
content for shareability by:

● Leveraging data for a compelling story
● Honing in on one message or idea per post
● Making content easily digestible, e.g., writing concisely and including graphs and
other visuals to support content
● Organizing information logically
● Extensive editing and rewriting
Mailchimp’s “Did You Mean Mailchimp?” campaign
A few years ago, email marketing platform Mailchimp partnered with an advertising
agency to create nine mini marketing campaigns for things that rhymed with its brand
name, including:

MailShrimp, JailBlimp, KaleLimp: surreal short films that screened in theaters
FailChips: bags of pre-crushed potato chips
NailChamp: an online competition for nail artists
SnailPrimp: an anti-aging beauty treatment
The goal: drive awareness of Mailchimp’s brand among small to medium-sized
businesses across various niches.

Source: Washington Post
The campaigns had little in common, but they were each designed to get attention—and
they worked. Media outlets like RollingStone, BuzzFeed, and PopSugar covered them;

then, when anyone turned to Google to look up one of the campaigns, they’d land on
Mailchimp.

In the end, the whole campaign generated 988 million earned media impressions and
67 million organic searches.

User-Generated Content
Instead of using in-house employees or contractors to create content, this strategy
mostly depends on a company’s users.

There are two types of user-generated content (UGC):

● SEO-focused: Users create content about a brand in relation to topics with high
search volume, e.g., product or company reviews.
● Virality-focused: Users create content about a brand in such a way that piques
other people’s interest and gets them to share.
Regardless of what type it is, brands leverage UGC for their marketing strategies, e.g.,
by incorporating it in their email campaigns. In this way, successful UGC strategies are
made up of two parts:

Encouraging users to create content about your brand
Leveraging this content for marketing campaigns
Again, UGC strategies are more product-dependent compared to editorial content
strategies. While we cover some tactics below, our program doesn't include projects for
this content marketing approach.

What does excellent content look like?
UGC varies widely, so excellence doesn’t fit a single mold. Instead, it’s most successful
when it builds consumer trust.

Because of this, great UGC is best defined by authenticity —that is, how honest or
realistic does a piece of content seem to be?

The more authentic, the better, because UGC that seems fake leads to skepticism.

How to encourage UGC
Adobe is an example of a company where users naturally create content through its
product, but not all companies have a product that does this. To encourage UGC, try
these four tactics:

Create targeted hashtags.
Host contests and giveaways.
Incentivize customers to leave reviews.
Make your review process frictionless.
Create targeted hashtags.
Hashtags invite UGC and increase your brand’s chances of being discovered on social
media. They can be easily included in marketing campaigns for a variety of purposes:

● Events
● Promotions
● Contests and giveaways
● Product launches
● Recruiting
Hashtags also consolidate UGC in one place, creating a library of content for your brand
to pull from.

For instance, Canva encourages users to share their design creations and tag
#canvalove on Instagram.

Wayfair encourages customers to share their home decor photos and tag
#wayfairathome on Instagram.

To create an effective hashtag:

● Decide on its main goal. Is it to promote a giveaway, build a community, or
something else?
● Pick which social network to focus on. Instagram UGC is image-based, while
Twitter mostly uses text. Decide which platform best fits your hashtag goal. (It’s
also okay to use the same hashtag across multiple platforms.)
● Make it short and unique. Long hashtags are hard to remember and tag
correctly. Generic hashtags are also hard to remember and risk being used for
other brands’ campaigns.
Good hashtags can be either branded or unbranded. While branded hashtags obviously
relate to your company, unbranded hashtags are a chance to connect with trends,
movements, and emotion for more engagement.

Coursera uses #LearnWithoutLimits to encourage new and returning students in their
education journey.

HydroFlask uses #ParksForAll to support park restoration and #HeyLetsGo to inspire
outdoor adventures.

Slack used #ReinventWork to encourage discussion about workplace changes resulting
from the coronavirus pandemic.

Experiment with all three and see what works for your company.

Host contests and giveaways.
On its own, a catchy hashtag can inspire some users to create content. But you can
incentivize more users by hosting a contest or giveaway that requires UGC for
participation.

Mobile game company Niantic did this with its #SustainableWithNiantic campaign,
which offered in-game rewards for people who shared about doing work for
sustainability on social media.

Besides generating UGC, the branded hashtag helped give exposure to Niantic while
also emphasizing its eco-conscious brand values.

The consignment store thredUP hosted a weeklong #FashionMindfulness challenge,
inviting users to share photos of their thrifted outfits.

The campaign helped to spread brand awareness for thredUP while also emphasizing
its eco-conscious brand values.

Here's one more example from Hootsuite, who ran a #IWorkFromHere contest series.

Every week for six weeks, the campaign invited users to share images of their
workspace using Hootsuite’s free app. The grand prize: a trip for two to anywhere in the
world.

What made this campaign a success? It appealed to one of Hootsuite’s target segments
(nomadic social media professionals and remote workers from around the world). And
since submitting a contest entry involved downloading Hootsuite’s app, it got people
who weren’t already using the software to give it a chance.

Incentivize customers to leave reviews.
Research shows that users are more motivated to leave a review after a poor
experience—so companies must be proactive in getting satisfied customers to share
their experience. One way to do so is by offering a small gift or reward as an incentive.

That could be:

● Discount or credit for your product
● Free or exclusive resource
● Charitable donation
● Monetary gift, e.g., a Visa gift card
Make your review process frictionless.
If the review process seems complicated, users won’t participate, even with an
incentive. Make it easier with these three tactics:

Ask for reviews at an appropriate time. The right time depends on when users
find value in your product. For example, it would make sense for TurboTax to ask
customers for a review immediately after they’ve finished using its software to file
taxes.
Give users different options for leaving a review. Review platforms have
different requirements for who can leave a review. For example, Trustpilot
requires users to create an account, and Clutch requires a LinkedIn account.
Give users multiple options with direct links so they can pick the easiest one for
them.
Provide some template language. In your ask, list your product’s key features
and benefits. This way, users won’t have to think too deeply about what feedback
to give.
How to leverage UGC
Getting users to create content is only half of a UGC strategy. Just as important is
leveraging UGC for your wider content marketing efforts, generally through repurposing.

You can repurpose UGC in several ways:

● Website: Add reviews to your homepage or in a dedicated testimonials page.
You can also quote reviews to showcase specific product features or explain
different use cases. If users create things through your product, share these
creations in blog posts or a curated gallery.
● Email: Use reviews as social proof in abandoned cart campaigns. You can also
curate UGC as examples of what prospects could do with your product in
promotional emails.
● Social media: Repost UGC on social channels to build a community. Remember
to give credit to the original creators.
Outside of content marketing, UGC also helps with understanding customer sentiment
about your product. Look for recurring themes—for instance, what features users are
most likely to praise or complain about. Then use this insight to improve your product;
this can generate even more positive UGC in the long run.

Examples of effective UGC
UGC/SEO – Yelp
Yelp’s content strategy is built on leveraging UGC to rank well in search results. It ranks
for more than 28 million keywords, many of which are for business reviews.

People leave reviews for a few reasons:

● They want to give kudos to great businesses.
● They want to warn others about bad businesses.
● They want to join the Yelp Elite Squad, an exclusive community of active users
that Yelp rewards with events and freebies—Yelp’s way of incentivizing people to
leave reviews.
There’s a good chance anyone wanting to learn about a local business or restaurant will
land on Yelp because these review pages rank so highly in Google’s search results. The
best part: most of these review pages weren’t created by Yelp but rather, real-life
business customers.

UGC/virality – Adobe
Adobe runs multiple social media accounts for its various software products. For
example, on Twitter alone, there’s @Creativecloud, @Photoshop, @Acrobat, and
@AdobeDocCloud.

Each account engages with users in a targeted way. For example, Adobe’s Instagram
accounts invite users to share projects according to their latest hashtag themes.

Some of these hashtags are branded, e.g., #CreativeCloud_Charmed and #Ps_Bloom.
This helps to collect all tagged UGC but also drives brand awareness through each
creator’s network.

Adobe capitalizes on this UGC by reposting it and giving credit to the original creators.
Posts regularly receive thousands of likes and hundreds of comments.

Social media isn’t the only channel where Adobe leverages its user-created content,
though. It also publishes “roundup” posts on its blog, showing off user projects for
different themes.

These blog posts aren’t keyword-optimized. The main point of them is to show off
user-created content, which also creates a feedback loop:

● Users want to be featured by Adobe to grow their own reputations.
● Users create content and tag Adobe.
● Adobe features this UGC across multiple channels, driving more brand
awareness.
● New users come across this content and want to be featured by Adobe.
UGC/SEO – G2
G2 is a business software marketplace and review site that helps businesses compare
different software and IT services, and its website ranks for more than 1.5 million
keywords. Though G2 does publish blog posts, a big part of its content strategy is
customer reviews of software products. Nearly a third of its ranking keywords are for
G2’s software review profiles.

How does the G2 team encourage UGC?

G2 partners with the software companies shown on its site and emails their customers
to ask for reviews. Here’s one example, where G2 offers a $25 Amazon gift card for
users to review the sales prospecting software Seamless.ai.

Looking at G2’s profile page about Seamless.ai, there are more than 475 user
reviews—a lot more than on Capterra, TrustPilot, and other review sites. This helps the

page’s strong SEO performance; it ranks #1 in Google’s search results for the phrase
“seamless ai reviews” and #4 for “seamless ai”.

And it’s not just Seamless.ai that G2 collects user reviews for—G2 uses this strategy for
hundreds of other software products.

There’s a good chance anyone searching for reviews about a business software on
Google will land on G2. The best part: most of these review pages weren’t created by
G2 but rather, real-life software users.

UGC/SEO – Casper

Knowing that their products are big investments for customers, the online mattress
company Casper made getting social proof a big part of its content strategy.

After customers buy a mattress, Casper emails them to ask for a review. To help
customers write more detailed feedback, its form includes a few questions as prompts.

Source: Sleeknote
How does Casper use this UGC for SEO?

It features customer testimonials on a dedicated landing page that ranks #1 in search
results for the keyword phrase “casper reviews”. The page includes customer reviews
for each of its mattress products so users can quickly toggle between them for a quick
snapshot of real people’s experiences.

In case users want to explore one specific product further, they can also click “See all
reviews”—which leads them to another page with all reviews for a single product.

For many companies, branded review keywords often lead to third-party review sites
rather than the brand being judged. However, creating these product-specific review
pages puts Casper’s website at the top of search results for all of these keywords,
including:

● casper platform bed reviews
● casper mattress protector review
● casper bed frame review
● casper nova hybrid review
UGC/virality – GoPro

GoPro’s action cameras make it the perfect candidate for a virality and UGC-based
content strategy. Customers are naturally eager to share their footage, and GoPro also
incentivizes them to do so by setting up Awards challenges.

These challenges, split into different photo and video categories, offer cash prizes, free
gear, and exposure. People submit their footage, which GoPro then repurposes for its
blog, YouTube channel, and social media accounts.

This content regularly gets hundreds of thousands of views, likes, and comments. Even
better, it creates a feedback loop of engagement:

● Users want to be featured by GoPro.
● So they create content and submit it to GoPro. They also post it on their own
channels and tag GoPro.
● GoPro features this UGC across multiple channels, driving more brand
awareness.
● New users come across this content and want to be featured.
Content Distribution
Remember that there are two parts to successful content marketing: creation and
distribution. Without any distribution efforts, even the best content won’t reach its target
audience.

Here are the three ways to categorize distribution:

Owned: When you leverage your brand’s own channels (e.g., social media
accounts) to publish and promote content
Acquired: When you appeal to or work with other brands to promote content on
their owned channels
Organic: When other parties promote your content voluntarily, without any efforts
from your brand
Organic distribution is great because it requires no effort from you—but it doesn’t come
easily.

Getting widespread distribution requires upfront work. As your brand’s reputation
develops, organic content distribution becomes more likely. Strangers share your
content on social media, and other websites link to it.

To position your company for this, we’ll focus on how to distribute content through
owned and acquired channels.

Distribution tactics
There are two common tactics for promoting content:

● Repurposing: Modifying content for another channel or as a new format
● Cold outreach: Contacting people you don’t know, usually through email or
social media
These tactics will come up as we discuss different distribution channels.

Distribution channels
There are four key channels for distributing content:

Websites
Newsletters/email
Social media
Online communities
Here’s a quick overview of the different methods:

Owned Acquired

other formats (videos, as
blog posts)
● Syndicate blog posts on
Medium and submit them

● Repurpose existing
content for roundup posts

Websites
Two ways to distribute content through your site:

● Repurpose content as blog posts: This strategy is for content that isn’t already
on your site. For example, Robinhood repurposes its Fireside Chat video series
from YouTube as individual blog posts. You can do the same with infographics,
videos, podcast episodes, and anything else that doesn’t already live on your
blog.
● Syndicate blog posts on Medium: Republish blog posts from your site onto
Medium using the platform’s import feature. Then submit your content to relevant
Medium publications to amplify its reach.
You can also promote content through other websites (acquired distribution) in a few
ways:

● Guest blogging: A guest post is a blog post created by your brand for another
site, and usually includes a link back to your site. Guest posts are often used for
SEO-based content strategies because Google considers links from reputable
sites as a ranking factor.
● Mentions: A mention is a link to your brand’s content on another website. Brands
can get mentions through outreach to websites, influencers, and journalists. You
can also use platforms like HARO to connect with journalists interested in your
industry.
● Curated posts: Some websites compile original content from multiple
contributors into a single blog post. Brands can pitch their content to be included,
though some websites also independently select content to feature in these
roundup posts. Others invite people to contribute.
Newsletters and email
For brands with an existing email list, newsletters are an easy means of content
distribution. Use them to share new pieces of content with existing subscribers. This
usually involves repurposing some text from a blog post as a teaser to get readers
interested.

For more distribution, encourage readers to share your newsletter with others, just as
Medium does in its writer newsletter.

Many companies, like the Skimm and The Hustle, send newsletters with curated
content. If you’re connected with businesses that do this, try reaching out to ask for your
content to be included. Or use cold outreach to pitch them on including your content.

Social media
You can leverage social media for content distribution through your brand’s business
page, personal accounts, and social groups.

Important note: Posting a link to your content on social media isn’t enough to get users
to click or share it. You must also create unique copy for each platform explaining why
your content is worth checking out.

For example, here’s how Betterment promotes one of its blog posts on Facebook.

It’s short and to the point, and it also tags #stimuluscheck to make it visible to anyone
interested in this topic.

Businesses just starting out may not have a strong presence on social media. In that
case, use your personal social media accounts to share content.

Besides business pages, brands can also promote content through social media
groups. You can find relevant groups that already exist or create a community for your
users. For example, Airbnb encourages its hosts to connect and share tips with one
another in Facebook groups.

Groups are a great place to engage users and share your brand’s new content.
However, it’s important to avoid being overly promotional or sales-y. Instead, focus on
explaining why a piece of content is valuable to get engagement.

Instant Pot created a Facebook community to share recipes and cooking tips.

Important note: self-promotion is usually frowned upon in these communities. Focus
instead on explaining why a piece of content is valuable to get engagement.

Online communities
These are interactive platforms where users can post content, discuss it, and even vote
on it, including:

● Reddit
● Quora
● Product Hunt
● Hacker News
● Growth Hackers
● Relevant Slack groups (find them on Standuply or /r/SlackHangouts on Reddit)
Join existing online communities or create your own to interact with potential customers
and share your content.

But like social media groups, don’t overtly promote your content. For example, Reddit’s
guidelines advise a 9:1 ratio, in which “only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions
should be your own content.” Add value first, then share your content.

Amplifying content with paid marketing
We don’t recommend this approach for most businesses. It’s very difficult to make paid
acquisition work by sending people to articles instead of to landing pages.

Specifically, it takes a lot longer for people to buy your product when they reach you
through an article. But it costs just as much to run an ad that points at your landing
page. You’re bidding on the same keywords and targeting the same audience. It’s just
that the URL and ad copy is slightly different.

In other words, your CPC (cost per click) stays the same. So you may as well get paid
sooner and point your ad at your landing page. Let your content’s SEO and other
marketing efforts slowly warm leads so that your paid ads are more effective.

There are only a couple cases where you’d want to run ads to an article instead of to
your landing page:

● When you know your customer will need to read a lot of information written by
you to buy from you, and you can’t stick it all in your landing page.
● When you need to build a lot of trust with your customer before they buy from
you, and you can’t build trust purely through a sales call, a demo, testimonials, or
a landing page.
This is most often the case for complicated, high LTV products. With them, we’ll point
ads at content to help educate them on the product. Then we’ll retarget them with ads
that point to our landing page. Because they’re more educated on the topic, they should
be more likely to convert at this point.

If you’re a B2B product, LinkedIn is a particularly good ad channel for this — after
someone clicks an ad, you’ll want to “gate” the content by asking for someone’s email
address before they can see it. This is, in fact, one of the only ways LinkedIn ads can be
profitable.

You can also link to your articles on other publications to teach people about your
product using a platform like Taboola. You’ve probably seen Taboola ads before at the
bottom of news articles:

The best distribution channel for your
business
We’ve found that most companies get faster distribution results by first leveraging their
brand relationships and user affinity.

● Brand relationships: You and your brand’s relationships with other companies,
influencers, or thought leaders
● User affinity: Your brand’s existing presence on social media and its email
subscriber list
Some acquired distribution channels rely on cold outreach to distribute content. Though
PR tools like BuzzStream and Hunter can automate it, cold outreach usually has a low
ROI, with an average response rate between 1% and 3%.

Why does cold outreach usually fail?

● Your intended recipient never reads your message. You contact the wrong
person or your message lands in the spam or junk folder. Or, your recipient
ignores your message.
● Your message isn’t compelling. It doesn’t make a strong case for why your
content matters.
● Your message isn’t personalized. It uses generic template language.
People prefer familiarity, which is why we recommend that brands use existing
relationships and user affinity for distribution. Instead of spending time and effort on cold
outreach, look for opportunities in your network.

Consider:

● How many email subscribers does your brand have?
● Does your brand have a strong presence on any social media channel?
● What social media accounts are you personally active on?
● Do you have any relationships with other brands, e.g., parent/sister companies,
an incubator?
● Do you have any relationships with journalists, influencers, or thought leaders?
● Are you part of any online communities?
Companies with strong brand relationships and user affinity have an advantage in
distributing their content.

Some companies don’t have strong brand relationships or user affinity—but companies
are made of people, who almost always have personal networks that can be tapped
into. Even companies without brand relationships and user affinity can still leverage
their personal networks for distribution.

For companies with fewer brand relationships and less user affinity, begin by promoting
content on your personal social media accounts. Join online communities in your
industry and become an active participant. Over time, you’ll build new relationships that
you can then use for content distribution.

For example, Eric Bandholz, the founder of Beardbrand, used Reddit to build a
community of around 300 members for his blog and YouTube channel before even
launching an ecommerce shop.

Source: Sleeknote
Since then, he’s consistently been active on Reddit, sharing his personal experiences
building Beardbrand and other business ventures on r/entrepreneur. Although he talks
about Beardbrand, Bandholz doesn’t do so promotionally—instead, a lot of his content
is about helping other entrepreneurs, e.g., his post on what it’s like to go on “Shark
Tank.”

Posting on Reddit not only helped spread the word about Beardbrand, it also developed
a network of readers interested in Bandholz and his work.

The bottom line: leverage existing connections first instead of doing cold outreach.

Building a Content Marketing Team
Brands have two options for how they actually do content marketing:

Manage content projects internally , e.g., through in-house marketers and
content creators
Outsource content projects , e.g., to freelance writers, agencies, or consultants
For sustainable content-driven growth, we recommend hiring at least one dedicated
content marketer.

Why? Someone needs to fully own all of your brand’s content marketing efforts and be
invested in using content to grow your company.

Freelancers with multiple clients have a lower chance of success here because they
have competing priorities. For the same reason, you shouldn’t split up marketing work
among multiple team members.

Later on, you can grow that single content marketer’s role into overseeing full-time
writers and/or freelancers. Or make them the point person for working with an agency.
But starting out, there should be, at minimum, one person focused on content.

Strategists and creators
Marketing talent often shows up in one of two forms:

● Strategists: Marketers skilled in ideating, research, and analysis
● Creators: Marketers skilled in writing, editing, or design
These roles aren’t mutually exclusive—in fact, the best content marketers are both.

How to hire excellent content marketers
We’ve got six tips for finding and screening content marketing candidates:

Share your job posting on Twitter or LinkedIn. Traditional job boards don’t
attract content marketing talent because the best candidates are already working
at other startups or in non-traditional settings (like freelancing full-time). So post
your open role on your personal Twitter or LinkedIn account and ask users to
comment if they’re interested.
Find candidates in growth communities. Join growth marketing Slack groups
and see who’s discussing topics relevant to your company. Message members
with obvious expertise and ask if they’re interested in a new role.
Ask for samples of candidates’ work and content ideas. Remember that the
ideal content marketer is both a strategist and a creator. Work samples speak to
a candidate’s skills in creating content, and content ideas show their ability to
research your brand and come up with relevant topics.
Prioritize writing skills over subject matter expertise. Don’t pass over
candidates just because they don’t have experience in your industry. Knowledge
about a topic can be developed relatively quickly into expertise; becoming a
better writer takes a lot more time.
Test candidates with a freelance project. Test assignments provide a more
realistic idea of how a candidate might perform if hired. If different types of
content projects are expected of the role, vet them with more than one
assignment. For example, at Demand Curve, we test content writers with 2-3
projects. The added benefit of testing candidates is that they’ll also get a better
sense of what working for your company is like.
Pay well. Top content marketers that generate consistent quality don’t come
cheaply. Pay well to attract better candidates.
Content Writing Guidelines
Editorial objective
The first rule of content writing is to write for quality.

Until you've established quality in a reader's mind, they won't carefully read.

Instead:

● They'll skim your content.
● They won't fully appreciate your arguments.
● They'll assume you're just trying to sell them something (instead of educate).
Most blogs are bad. So much content already exists, and new content is published so
frequently that people default to skim-reading for highlights.

The antidote to skimming is quality. When readers recognize quality, they slow down.
They treat you like a good book.

Defining quality
Quality stems from four factors:

Concision
Clarity
Depth
Engagement
Concision
Are you conveying your points without fluff? It's often more effective to forgo your
"writer's personality" and witticisms—and write clinically.

Here’s an example of content that isn’t concise:

What is the best drone for beginners? For a beginner, there are a few drones
that stand out on this list, but the drone you get heavily depends on what kind of
beginner you are. If you’re looking at getting into drones because you like flying
things and you want something to learn on, the Bugs 3 is a great choice. If you’re
just looking for something to fly for fun around the house and bash around, you
will probably want to look at the Mambo FPV.

There’s one other type of beginner that isn’t looking for either of those things.
Some beginners just want a drone to take pictures and videos with. They need
whatever drone they get to be easy to fly and have decent specs, but not break
the bank. For those people, the DJI Spark is going to be the best option. There’s
no reason to buy the other two drones I mentioned if you want to shoot videos and
take pictures. The Spark is actually easier to fly than the Bugs 3 and Mambo FPV,
so you don’t have to worry as much about the flying part.

Here’s that same content, written concisely:

What is the best drone for beginners? It depends.

If you want something fun to fly around the house, get the Mambo FPV. If you
want to learn good technique, get the Bugs 3. If you want to take beautiful pictures
and videos, get the DJI Spark.

Every article should be organized to answer the searcher’s query thoroughly and
quickly.

For example, if someone googles "Does the SIBO diet work?" they don’t need two
paragraphs at the top of the article defining SIBO. Their query makes it clear they have
a working understanding of SIBO.

Instead, structure your article to answer the question. You can always provide context
later in the article—if you want.

Clarity
Are you getting your points across fully and seamlessly? Or does the reader need to
guess and re-read? To find out, ask readers for their feedback.

Here’s an example of content that isn’t clear, taken from a post titled “The Ultimate
Guide to Team Synergy”:

In modern organizational theory, synergy means much more than “working
together.” Synergy is actually a systemic principle that explains how a team's
collective performance is unpredictable based solely on its member’s individual
performances. Therefore, a team’s collective performance can be either better or
worse than the sum of its members’ individual performances. This introduces a
level of risk that is widely overlooked by most authors and that holds the key to
understanding organizational success versus organizational failure.

The more big words you have, the tougher your writing is to read. Avoid big words until
you need them.

Instead, give specific examples. For example, if we were actually trying to explain
“synergy”:

Amanda runs a blog that gives career advice using cute cartoons. Thousands of
college students read it every month. She's spent months trying to come up with a
way to monetize it. But nothing works.

Michael runs a recruiting agency that places recent college grads at entry-level
sales jobs. But he's having trouble finding recent college grads.

Amanda and Michael meet at a friend's birthday party. They brainstorm together.
Amanda ends up making a new cartoon, based on sales careers, with a link to
Michael's site in it. People click through, and Michael pays Amanda every time he
places someone who came through her site.

Independently, they would have gotten stuck. But together, they found a way to
solve each other's problems. And ended up with something better than they would
have gotten individually. That's synergy.

Depth
Go beyond what people already know—without going unnecessarily into the weeds. To
figure out the best depth to go, first become intimately familiar with the full range of
material.

For example, you’ve probably read many blog articles with career advice about
“following your passion.” That’s not deep. That’s self-evident. Someone searching for
career advice will get disappointed and move on. They’ve already heard it.

Compare that with a post titled: “To find work you love, don’t always follow your passion.
Job data says so.”

There are a couple things that imply depth, just from the title alone:

The conclusion is counter-intuitive (“Wait, the advice I’ve been reading is
wrong?”)
The title shows that the author has done the research. There's data, and they’ve
researched enough to know that most people say to follow your passion.
There is some nuance. The title says “don’t always,” which means there’s more
to tease apart.
Engagement
Are you hooking readers in? Are you exciting them about what they're learning? Are you
effectively conveying how valuable the material is?

To write great content, articulate what got you interested.

Visual writing guidelines
You have control over how people read your article just by how you space paragraphs,
bold words, and use headers.

Compare these two blog posts. (You can skim them.)

● Blog post 1 : Medium
● Blog post 2 : Equestrian Helmet
Why does the Medium post look so much better?

Aside from the tens of designers Medium has on their team, the writer themselves
actually formatted the post to look more compelling.

Specifically: Images stand alone on a line. They don’t wrap around text.

Bad

Good

Putting an image on its own line forces people to look at it exactly when you want them
to, because they’ll have to scroll through the article to keep reading. Like what we’re
doing in this reading.

There’s no random bolding or underlining.

Pick the two or three most important lines of your article and bold those. No more than
that. Otherwise, your reader will get distracted and overwhelmed.

Also, only underline links. If something is important, bold it.

Headers are larger, bolded, and separated from the text.

In the equestrian helmet article, headers are underlined and lumped in with the rest of
the text.

It’s impossible to skim or figure out how to read.

There’s proper spacing.

The equestrian helmet article doesn’t put space between paragraphs. The sentences
themselves are also too close together.

Medium has picked a great line height, so reading the article doesn’t make you feel
cramped.

Use bulleted and numbered lists.

Lists create visually appealing spacing. They also force writers to shorten their
sentences and organize their ideas more clearly.

Plus, bulleted lists are often what appear as featured snippets on results pages. Here’s
an example:

We Googled how to sleep better and faster. Google added this featured snippet at the
top of the page, before any other organic result—namely because it knows readers will
appreciate the brevity and clarity of the numbered list.

Include a table of contents.

A table of contents with links to specific sections of your content can increase the time
readers spend on your page—which benefits your SEO. Here’s an example of a table of
contents that links to every H2 header on the page:

This table of contents feature can also increase your chances of having a jump to
section appear in search results.

Embedding keywords
For most blog posts, you’ll be targeting a very specific keyword, like equestrian helmet
for round heads.

Make sure the keyword itself shows up naturally a few times in the article—but don’t
force it. Google penalizes unnatural keyword repetition (known as "keyword stuffing").

Don't target only your primary keyword, either. Google rewards posts that fully respond
to a searcher’s intent. As important as it is to target your specific keyword, it’s equally
important to target the theme of the keyword, and the searcher’s intent.

That means including related secondary and tertiary keywords into your post.

To identify secondary and tertiary keywords:

● Search for your target keyword in Google.
● Review the top 6-10 results. Make a list of some of the common words and
phrases you see repeated.
● Take note of how each top-ranking article structures its content. Namely, what
phrases do they use in their subheaders?
This exercise can be very time-consuming. Clearscope is a tool that does the work for
you, but it’s pretty expensive. We cover it in a bonus lesson. It analyzes your keyword
and lists out a list of supplemental keywords top-ranking articles use (as well as how
frequently each word appears in these articles).

See below:

In the image above, our keyword is kefir vs. yogurt.

The list you see features the most relevant terms other articles use, how often, as well
as the importance of that word in relation to your chances of ranking.

We'll teach you more about Clearscope in a bonus lesson, later.

Titles
The title must include the keyword you’re targeting, letter-for-letter, fully intact, and early
on in the title.

Examples
Good example of a title (where eczema is the keyword we’re targeting)

"Is my eczema linked to diet?"

● ✔It uses the keyword early on.
● ✔ It’s used in the first three words—even earlier is better but not if it
results in weird grammar or compromises your ability to write something
with a hook. ← Important
● ✔It is in line with the reader’s mindset.
● ✔It’s phrased in a way similar to how the reader would think.
● ✔It encourages the reader to click it to answer the question.
Bad example

"Skin problems, like eczema, and their relationship to diet. Only at DietSkin."

● 🚫Keyword (eczema) is buried further away from the front end of the title.
● 🚫The title isn’t enticing.
● 🚫The character length is 84. That’s too much.
● 🚫‘Only at DietSkin’ is sales/marketing speak. Avoid these tactics.
Title Advice
Look at the top Google responses for your keyword. Find a way to title your
content so it stands out. Make it interesting and compelling—but don’t write
misleading clickbait.

It should include a hook that encourages the reader to click: Consider the mindset of the
target audience. What are they looking to have answered?

Make sure the title is representative of the post’s content and isn’t a bait and switch.

If you don’t satisfactorily fulfill the promise of the title by the end of the post, people will
click Back in their browser and your SEO performance will deeply suffer. Always give
users exactly what they came for.

Technical advice
The title you use depends on what (1) is most interesting to click on and (2) stands out
from the other search results.

● Simple description
○ Eczema examples with pictures and explanations
○ Types of eczema and what they look like on your skin
● Short hook - Pique their curiosity.
○ Is my eczema linked to my diet? How to find out.
● Colon divider - Summarize the content of your post
○ Eczema and diet: How they're connected.
○ Eczema: How to improve symptoms by fixing your diet.
○ Use capital case:
■ Example: The Last of the Mohicans
■ Explanation: Only use capital letters for the principal words.
Articles, conjunctions, and prepositions are capitalized only when
they start the title.
○ Max 60 characters. (Or else it will be truncated!)
■ Use this tool to measure character length.
■ And use Moz's Title Tag Preview Tool to see how your title will look
on Google.
How to Convert with Content
To convert users, content should accomplish two things:

1. It should solve the reader’s problem.

It should comprehensively answer their Google search query if they arrived organically,
and regardless, inform them with the material that they expect (after reading the article
title, for example). We call this finality : your page is the final search result that people
should click, and they shouldn’t have to go back to Google.

This increases organic traffic. Google boosts pages that completed a user's search for
an answer.

2. It should move your reader further down the funnel.

The best content has real ROI. In other words, your content should move readers
further down the funnel—or closer to buying your product—as they engage with your
content.

This may not be right away. It may be over numerous steps and many months.

But it should ultimately be driving readers towards something. You want them to
subscribe to the newsletter, share the post, come back for future posts, read on to other
posts, and to learn about and purchase your product.

Choose relevant topics, include CTAs, and mention your product without being too
salesy. Over time, readers should be excited to convert because they've learned that
your product can solve their problem.

Conversion suggestions
Improve finality by linking to few external sites within
the text itself
Articles should generally not link out to external sites. These are all places readers can
bounce and never come back.

But sometimes you may want to reference outside sources like research results. It’s
best to do that with quotes or screenshots. Put the links to those sites in a “Footnotes”
or “Bibliography” section instead to keep the integrity of the reference.

Structure articles to funnel folks towards one
conclusion—they must use your product
The majority of articles should be structured so the reader says, “Oh wait, #{your
product} would let me do [this]? That’s cool.”

The basic formula for posts would be:

● What problems do our readers have that we can solve?
● Let’s show them how to solve these problems in a general way, while carefully
emphasizing why your product is clearly the best solution for them and their
lifestyle or business.
For example, HubSpot wrote a famous blog post on how to get a HubSpot experience
by using WordPress. The crux of the article is: “It's possible—but it’s a pain to do, not as
secure, and will cost you more than if you just use HubSpot.”

But they don’t frame the article like that. It’s framed in a way that’s a real guide for folks
who want to know how to get a HubSpot experience without using HubSpot (a search
term with some traffic, thus HubSpot is grabbing ownership of that term). An article like
this is worth pursuing.

Ask yourself:

● Where in the post can we embed GIFs and videos that show the product in use,
related to the topic being discussed?
● How can we add an appropriate CTA at the end that readers will be more inclined
to click?
Include mentions of your business
Since every piece of content you write should be at least tangentially related to your
product, it’s OK to drop a link to it in the middle of an article—as long as it’s natural.

Add this link in the blog post where you’re actually discussing the problem that your
product solves; don’t drop it in at random. Otherwise, you’ll annoy your reader.

For example: Fomo is a widget you stick on your landing page to show visitors a live
feed of the people who just bought your product:

Here’s a snippet from a blog post they wrote about a fine art client of theirs:

The link is natural. It fits in with the surrounding paragraphs. And it solves a problem:
many business owners don’t have social proof on their website.

Mark Incomplete

Sourcing Article Ideas
In general, the content you write should solve a problem that someone is searching for.
We’ll have you do keyword research as part of the project to find the biggest problems,
using data.

But sometimes, you’ll want to write something without thinking about search results, just
to keep your existing audience aware of you and delight them with special knowledge
you uniquely have.

If you’re looking for go-to content ideas—beyond doing search keyword
analysis—here’s where to start.

Google keyword trends
Do this after you initially come up with keywords to target (we have you do this in our
project).

Go to Google Trends. Look at the search volume trends for the keywords that show up
related to your topic/industry. Is anything gaining popularity, or is anything spiking?

Trending on Twitter
Follow people in your industry and see what types of content they’re sharing, and check
the trending section to see what people are talking about now.

Ask your target audience (your
customers)
Include a topic suggestion form on your site.

At the end of the articles you write, ask people to share article ideas either in comments,
emails, or through the form.

Repackage content
Find the news aggregators (e.g. Reddit, Product Hunt) that are influential in your
market. Monitor them for content that flies under the radar—due perhaps to an
unenticing title, boring intro paragraph, or poor writing. Then rewrite that content into
something more engaging. (And credit your sources.)

periodic email summaries.)

Whenever a topic trends throughout these digests, consider writing a roundup review.
Summarize what's happening in a concise, easy-to-reference post.

Competitor piggybacking
Make a list of the companies in your market. Then, install the Buzzsumo Chrome
extension.

When you visit each website on your list, the extension will automatically detect their
total engagement. Click on the extension's icon. It'll show which of your competitors'
posts received the most Tweets, Facebook Likes, and more. This is an effective proxy
for determining which type of content most successfully appeals to their audience,
which can otherwise be difficult to assess.

Then write about these same topics but add something unique to warrant your entry into
the blogosphere.

If you don't mind paying, you can also sign up for Buzzsumo's Most-Shared Posts
feature then copy the results into a spreadsheet for later referencing.

Project: Determine your content
marketing strategy
In this project, you’ll walk through our framework for determining which content
marketing strategy is best for your company.

Our framework for deciding which content marketing strategy to use is based on six
pillars:

Search interest
Product shareability
User content
Data and research
Emotional appeal
Thought leadership
We’ve broken down each in more detail in our Content Marketing Scorecard. Make a
copy of this scorecard, and then read each statement in the Scorecard tab.

● If the statement applies, select "Yes".
● If the statement does not apply, select "No".
After answering all statements, look at the Results tab. Your responses will be summed
in the Your Score column. Look at the adjacent SEO/virality/UGC table to find out
which strategy best aligns with your answers.

Your company may not perfectly align with a single strategy. In reality, many companies
can find success with more than one strategy, not just exclusively SEO, virality, or UGC.
Our scorecard is designed to help identify which strategy may have the most potential
for success.

Project: Content distribution
This project is designed to help you find and prioritize potential distribution channels for
your content.

As discussed in our Content Distribution section, you can promote content on both
owned and acquired channels. We’ll walk you through each category.

To get started, make a copy of our content distribution worksheet.

Phase 1: Owned channels
We’ll start by looking at your owned distribution channels.

Open the Owned tab in the content distribution worksheet. This tab provides a
high-level overview of your owned channels. That includes:

● Your brand’s social media accounts
● Your company newsletter
● Your personal social media accounts
● Your personal newsletter
● Partners—any relationships you or your brand has with other companies or
influencers
Fill in the number of followers and subscribers for each channel, as well as its URL.
Then consider which channels have the strongest following.

As discussed in our Content Distribution section, we’ve observed that companies tend
to get faster distribution results by leveraging existing brand relationships and channels
with high user affinity.

For our example, we used the marketing analytics consulting company Trust Insights.
Looking at Trust Insights and its founders’ owned channels, it’s clear that the founders
have a stronger social media presence on their personal accounts than on Trust
Insights’ accounts. In this case, it makes sense to prioritize content distribution on these
owned personal channels first.

Phase 2: Acquired channels (Sponsored
posts)
Next, we want to amplify and expand our reach by tapping into acquired channels,
which include other publishers and communities.

Our worksheet has two tabs for this category:

● Acquired (Sponsored posts): Use this to track sponsored website and
newsletter placements.
● Acquired (Communities): Use this to track online communities relevant to your
industry.
We’ll start with the Acquired (Sponsored content) tab.

Sponsored content
We use the term “sponsored content” to describe a type of paid acquisition that
resembles a publisher’s editorial content. Unlike traditional ads, sponsored content isn’t
necessarily focused on making a hard sell; it tends to be educational in nature. This
might be a brief newsletter segment or a blog post on a website that publishes news
about your industry.

A few examples:

● HelloFresh sponsored a listicle titled “ 12 Things That Will Make Every Parent
Scream 'We Don’t Have Time'” on BuzzFeed.
● Fidelity Investments partnered with Morning Brew to create Fresh Invest, a
podcast series about investing.
● The sales software tool timetoreply sponsored an educational segment about
response time in theCLIKK’s newsletter.
The most effective kinds of sponsored content are those that actually reach your target
audience. Given this, you should consider what websites and newsletters your target
users regularly visit or subscribe to. For example, a B2B software company might look
for sponsored content opportunities with a website like FastCompany rather than
BuzzFeed.

You may already know major websites and newsletters in your niche. To quickly find out
whether a specific site allows sponsored content, try a site search on Google with
phrases like “advertise with us.” For example, to see if FastCompany offers sponsored
content opportunities, you could Google:

site:fastcompany.com “advertise with us”
site:fastcompany.com “sponsored content”
As for newsletters in your niche, take a look at past issues to find out whether they have
advertising opportunities; and if so, how their sponsored content actually appears in the
email.

To find other relevant newsletters, Google your niche and “newsletters.” Lists of the top
newsletters may appear, like so:

Even if publishers don’t outright say they allow sponsored content, it’s always worth
reaching out to ask.

When you find a relevant site or newsletter that allows sponsored content, enter their
details in the Acquired (Sponsored content) tab. Use this tab to compare different
publishers—most will often give you details about their readership and engagement.

Phase 3: Acquired channels
(communities)
In the content distribution spreadsheet’s Acquired (Communities) tab, we’ll focus on
finding relevant online communities you can promote your content in.

You’ll need to do some digging to find these communities. This means manually
searching for topics your product relates to across different platforms, like Facebook
and LinkedIn. However, you should also consider:

● Quora: Quora organizes content by topic, letting users follow each topic so they
can see the latest questions and answers in each. Follow key topics related to
your industry and make note of relevant questions that you can answer with a
natural, non-promotional link back to your content.
● Reddit: There are probably one or two obvious subreddits related to your niche.
Use Sayit to find related subreddits based on where users are posting. For
example, entering “SEO” reveals an overlap with subreddits focused on social
media, affiliate marketing, and WordPress.
● Slack: Quality Slack communities can be hard to find. Oftentimes, general
purpose groups devolve into spammy, self-promotional groups without genuinely
engaged members. Niche groups with active moderators tend to have the most
potential for meaningful content promotion. To find these groups, ask around your
network to find out what communities people are in. Also look through this
Airtable of niche Slack communities.
Record relevant forums and communities in the Acquired (Communities) tab. Sign up or
apply to join the ones where your target audience might be—then repurpose your
content for sharing in them. Remember to be mindful of each community’s rules and
culture; you should avoid coming off as sales-y or overly promotional.

Phase 4: Track distribution efforts
With so many distribution channels for promoting your content, it’s easy to lose track of
which ones you’ve already shared your content on. Use this checklist to keep track of

your distribution efforts. This will help avoid coming across as spammy to publishers
and communities.

Content Marketing Scorecard (^)
How to Use this
Scorecard
Search Interest
Yes/
No
Read each statement and
consider whether it applies to
your product/company.
If the statement applies, select
"Yes".
If the statement does not apply,
select "No".
After answering all statements,
look at the Results tab. Your
responses will be summed in the
Your Score column. Look at the
adjacent SEO/virality/UGC table
to find out which strategy best
aligns with your answers.
Note: Many companies can find
success with more than one
content marketing strategy, not
just exclusively one. Our
scorecard is designed to help you
identify which strategy may have
the most potential.
People frequently look up product reviews in your
industry and/or spend a long time researching their
options before making a purchase.
Example: Project management platforms,
nutritional supplements, personal electronics
Your niche/the problem you solve is relatively
complex. Users often have many questions.
Example: Many people new to digital marketing
search for SEO guides and tutorials.
There is a high search volume (>1,000) for your
main target keywords.
Product Shareability
Your product can be easily photographed or
recorded in action.
Example: GoPro, Airbnb
Your product has a unique design or appearance.
Example: PillowCube's square-shaped pillows
Your product is very innovative—there aren't many
competitors doing the same thing.
Example: Pair Eyewear, Squatty Potty, Acorns
User Content
Your product can be used to create content.
Example: People make GIFs and games with
Giphy. People create playlists on Spotify. People
record videos on Loom.
Users actively post images, reviews, or
testimonials about your product online.
Example: People share photos of their Warby
Parker frames on Instagram. Students and
teachers share finished Skillshare projects on
personal blogs.
A community exists for your users. This may be
one you've created or users have organically
created.

Example: Hosts on Airbnb have regional Facebook
groups to connect with other hosts. There are also
Instant Pot groups on Facebook for users to share
recipes.

Data and Research

Your company conducts industry research.
Example: Salesforce researches both B2B and
B2C companies in a variety of industries.

Your company has in-house data scientists or
researchers.

Your company has exclusive proprietary data.
Example: Zillow has real estate data about every
property listing created on its platform. Uber has
data about all of the trips taken using its rideshare
service.

Emotional Appeal

Your brand has a compelling or socially conscious
mission.
Example: Who Gives a Crap donates 50% of
profits to health initiatives.

Customers have a strong sense of brand loyalty to
your company or product.
Example: Apple, Nike, Lululemon, Starbucks

Your product can have a big emotional impact on
users.
Example: Headspace eases user's stress and
anxiety. 23andMe reveals details about people's
health, background, and genealogy.

Thought Leadership

There are well-known or established experts in
your industry.
Example: Brian Dean is known as an SEO expert.

You have a company figurehead—someone
knowledgeable about your industry and who
publicly represents your brand. Alternatively,
someone on your team is willing to be a company
figurehead.
Example: Tim Soulo is the figurehead for Ahrefs.

Your team has in-house experts that can educate
others about your industry.

We've added up your Scorecard answers for each

Introduction
Questions answered in this module
● What is SEO and LLMO and how do they work?
● What companies does SEO work best for?
● How do I structure my site for better SEO?
● What are the differences between on-page and off-page SEO?
● How do I build links to my content?
Overview
More than 189,000 searches happen on Google per second.

Even with the rapid adoption and expansion of LLMs (Large Language Models) like
ChatGPT, Perplexity, Grok, and Claude, Google searches are still growing (at least as
projected):

Source: https://explodingtopics.com/blog/google-searches-per-day
Conversely, ChatGPT processes about 1 billion prompts/messages per day (as of
2025), which is pretty crazy given its relatively short existence. It's safe to assume that
LLM usage will continue to increase exponentially.

SEO isn't dead or dying yet

Although the long-term future of classic Google Search is in question, it's at least here
for the foreseeable future.

Remember, Google is one of the most deeply ingrained habits and default behaviors in
the modern era. Habits are incredibly hard to break. Many people will continue to visit
Google (or simply type into their browser bar) whenever they have questions or are
looking for a website.

Even if Google completely loses the AI battle against its competitors, that momentum
will last them a long time.

And LLMs (AI) essentially do the same thing Google does

When you ask an LLM a question, it will either:

Use its training data to respond. This is baked into the LLM for when the
specific model was created and whenever the training data's cutoff was, which is
likely not recently (maybe even 2023).
Search to get you the answer. If you ask it for something recent or for
something that wasn't in its training data, it will search the Internet for the answer.
Obviously, getting your startup featured in #1 is mostly out of your control for two
reasons:

● The LLM creator needs to update its training data to be recent. You can't control
if or when they're going to do that.
● LLM creators are protective of what's in their training data, so you're kind of
guessing.
Therefore, it's probably a waste of time for a startup to try to game the LLMs to be the
default response for certain questions and prompts because it's a gamble on which data
the LLM creator includes and when it does it.

Instead, to get featured in an LLM, your site/content needs to be highly visible to
an LLM when it performs a search, so essentially, you need to do SEO.

Getting your site to rank on Google significantly increases the amount of traffic you'll get
from classic Google searches, and the amount of traffic you get from LLMs (Google's or
otherwise).

So SEO is definitely not dead. Even though classic Google Search may dwindle in
popularity, SEO as a field will continue because LLMs are essentially performing the
search on your behalf.

Some accelerating trends
Over the past many years, these trends with Google Search have continued to
accelerate:

● Fewer and fewer searches end in clicks.
○ As of 2025, around 60% of searches finish without a single click.
○ This is increasingly due to data-rich results like stock charts,
Wikipedia-like embeds, and AI summaries and answers.
○ It's becoming increasingly important to be the cited or quoted source for
an LLMs answer or a Structured Snippet.
● More ads and more clicks are going to the ads.
○ In the early days of Google Search, there'd be 1-3 reasonably subtle ads
before the organic results. Now there's even more, and they're larger.
○ People are increasingly clicking these ads as well.
○ Although these are less likely to show for content-related queries since
they're less likely to end in a purchase transaction (so advertisers are less
able to get a positive ROAS from it).
● More searches are used as navigation.
○ ~44% of searches are for specific brands. This is people using Google to
find a site rather than typing in the URL of the site directly.
○ Given this, it's likely increasingly important to increase your startup's
visibility for its company/product name—especially if you don't use a .com
domain.

● Video is increasingly showing up in results.
○ Videos can often rank more easily than a piece of content especially if
you're new to SEO.
○ Pairing your articles with videos can increase the visibility of both the post
and the video.
○ This is less true for LLMs, but that will very likely change as LLMs start to
parse and search videos.
● Topical authority increasingly important
○ Having one article about a topic that has 10,000 backlinks is less of the
move nowadays.

○ Now you want to have lots of articles around a single topic to demonstrate
to Google that you're experts and it wasn't just a one-off.
● Personal branding and author reputation are rising factors
○ Google now uses "E-E-A-T" signals: Experience, Expertise,
Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness.
○ If you're a founder writing content, building up your own online presence
helps your site SEO.
○ Tactic: Attach real author bios to your content, get cited/interviewed
externally, and build your name up alongside your company’s brand.
● Content quality > keyword optimization
○ The old tactics of stuffing articles with keywords and and perfectly
optimized heading tags is increasingly unimportant.
○ What increasingly matters is how engaging the content is and how often it
satisfies people's search (they didn't hit back and click another link).
Both search engines and LLMs will continue to prioritize Experience, Expertise,
Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. The better your content is at that, the more
likely you'll get traffic from Google and LLMs.

For simplicity, when we say SEO and Google Search, you can also

assume we're talking about LLMs like ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and

Perplexity

Benefits of SEO
Besides getting your content in front of a wider audience, there are two other major
benefits of a successful SEO strategy:

● It’s a cost-effective source of traffic. SEO content builds compounding value
over time, with a long-term payoff from consistent traffic. There’s an upfront cost
to creating it, but in the long run, it’s generally much more efficient than paid
marketing or even other content strategies that require ongoing content
production.
● It increases brand authority and awareness. People tend to trust organic
search results more than paid results, so ranking highly for popular and relevant
keywords in your niche establishes your brand as an expert. Stronger online
visibility also means more users are aware of who you are and what you do.
● SEO leads to an increase in referral traffic. Working on SEO often leads to
increased backlinks to your website, which is also free traffic that compounds
over time.
● LLMs are likely to use similar metrics to determine what to cite. Sure,
search itself might change, but LLMs will almost certainly care about similar
things like:
○ Topical authority (how much authority does your site have for the specific
topic)
○ E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness)
○ Content quality (how engaging and likely it is to satisfy your
question/search)
● SEO can help grow your YouTube account.
○ If you embed accompanying
Our Content Marketing unit covers SEO in the context of content creation, so we’ll dive
into the more technical aspects in this module, like how to optimize your website. There
are other search engines such as Bing, Brave, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo, as well as
LLM Search, but we’ll focus on Google because roughly 92% of searches worldwide
come through Google.

What companies does SEO work best for?
For more details about whether your company should pursue a long-term SEO content
strategy, check out our Content Marketing module. But whether or not you pursue a
long-term SEO content strategy, all companies can benefit from at least the SEO basics
for greater online visibility, especially considering 44% of searches are for brand names.

Today’s consumers regularly use Google and LLMs to explore and consume content.
Even if they don’t have a short-term goal to buy something, people are exposed to and
learn about new products and services through search engines.

SEO has an exceptionally high ROI for companies that:

● Can afford to wait for results. SEO is a long-term strategy—it generally takes
at least six months before your content sees any traction in Google’s search
results.
● Have access to unique data, insights, research, and visualizations. Articles
containing unique research earn a lot more organic backlinks and shares as
other creators reference your research in their content.
● Have a broader content marketing strategy in place. SEO supports other
content efforts, and vice versa. Companies already investing in content
marketing strategies have a competitive advantage because they have existing
materials that can be repurposed as SEO content.
● Solve a defined problem that people search for information about. In
industries where users have lots of questions, like fintech and real estate, people
turn to Google for information. SEO doesn’t work so well for unclear problems
where users don’t even know a solution exists. Consider how infomercials often
sell products that address obscure, unobvious needs—before Snuggies became
popular, no one searched for “sleeved blankets.”
● Solve the same problem for many different groups or categories. For
example, Expedia shows hotel listings for cities worldwide, and Canva offers
design templates for all kinds of projects. These companies can
programmatically generate hundreds of pages about the variations of the
problem they solve—giving them tons of long-tail keyword coverage without
needing to write a lot of articles.
In short, SEO isn’t just for online businesses or nationwide chains. Even
brick-and-mortar shops that only sell locally benefit from it because people use Google
to find things nearby.

If you’re trying to decide how much priority SEO deserves, consider how many of the
above bullet points apply to your company. The more bullets that describe your
company, the more viable SEO may be for your business.

How does Google work?
Before we dive in, here’s some important background info on how Google works—it’ll
provide context on what you’re optimizing for.

Googlebot, bots from Google, scans content in a process called crawling to understand
what it’s about. This content gets logged in the Google index, a database of all content
crawled on the web.

Google then uses a series of algorithms to determine how each indexed piece of
content is ranked in its search results, with the ultimate goal to deliver the “most
relevant, helpful information.” It focuses on five key factors:

Meaning: What exactly are users looking for? Consider how a search for “lion”
shows results for both the animal and the 2016 movie starring Dev Patel.
Relevance: What content relates to a specific query? If you’re searching for
information about car loans, you’re not going to see results about mortgages
even though they’re also a type of loan.
Quality: Which content would be most helpful to a user? Google judges websites
based on expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-A-T) to determine
this.
Usability: What content is easy to read? Even if a piece of content actually
answers a search query, it’s not helpful if users can’t read or access it.
Context: What clues does a user’s location and search history give about their
search goal? This factor helps determine which content would be most useful to
a reader.
SEO is both an art and a science. Though it deals with algorithms, there’s no exact
formula for getting a page to rank at the top of search results. You need creativity to
make interesting and relevant content that users find valuable.

Some experts estimate that Google updates its algorithms more than a hundred times
per year, the details of which aren’t always made public. There are a lot of speculations
about what does and doesn’t work for SEO but naturally, what worked for SEO ten
years ago doesn’t work today.

Despite this, many of Google’s recent changes don’t dramatically affect current SEO
practices. We’ll cover only these effective, unchanging strategies that are backed by
extensive research and consistent with Google’s official statements.

SEO Tools
We’ll refer to a variety of SEO tools, both paid and unpaid, throughout this unit. Many
others exist, but these are the ones we recommend.

● Google Search Console (GSC): A free tool from Google that, along with Google
Analytics, measures your website’s traffic and search performance.
○ Search Analytics for Sheets: A helpful supplement for more easily
retrieving data from GSC since its exports are messy.
● Ahrefs: One of the most well-known paid SEO tools. It offers keyword data but
its biggest strength is backlink data and domain analysis.
○ Webmaster Tools: A free tool from Ahrefs that helps pinpoint SEO issues
on your site. You need to verify site ownership to use this.
● Clearscope: A paid tool for content optimization. It also provides keyword data
but its most valuable feature is its text editor, which grades your content and
suggests optimization tips.
● Semrush: A paid tool that’s best for keyword research.
● Keywords Everywhere: A freemium browser extension that shows rich keyword
data in SERPs, like search query variants and trend data.
Besides these tools, it’s also worth looking into the resources provided by Google itself
to understand the practices considered white hat SEO. White hat SEO encompasses
all of the ethical optimization strategies recommended by Google. It’s the opposite of
black hat SEO , manipulative techniques that violate Google’s guidelines.

Here are two helpful references for understanding what falls into these categories:

● Webmaster Guidelines: Basic principles for creating a website that Google
views favorably. The main takeaway here: don’t be deceptive.
● Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines: What human quality raters use to
evaluate websites and SERPs. Raters don’t directly affect rankings but help to
shape Google’s algorithms by giving feedback on how helpful SERPs are.
How to structure your website
Site architecture is one of the foundational pieces of practicing good SEO. It describes
how a website is structured, which affects how both users and Googlebot explore it. A
clear structure makes it easy to browse your site more efficiently.

Websites with poor site architecture are disorganized. Visitors get lost in them; it’s not
easy to find what they’re looking for. There may even be “orphan” pages, pages that can
be found in SERPs but not through any link on the website.

Image credit: Backlinko
The ideal site architecture uses a hierarchical structure that’s intuitive and easy to
navigate. Pages are grouped together as subcategories of broader categories, with
each page just a few clicks from one another. They generally follow this format:

https://www.example.com/category/subcategory/

Consider how Salesforce organizes its pages under higher-level categories like its
products, resources, and blog:

You should do the same for your site—create logical categories and subcategories to
organize how your pages are laid out. The exact process for creating this structure
depends on your content management system (CMS), whatever platform you’re using
to create and manage your web content, like WordPress, Webflow, Squarespace, and
so on.

In WordPress, for example, Page Attributes in your web page’s settings sidebar allows
you to categorize a page by nesting it under a “parent.”

How many landing pages should your
website have?
The exact number of landing pages your website should have is specific to your
company and what you sell. Instead of focusing on this number, focus on optimizing
your website for customers—how they might approach and navigate it for more
information before deciding whether or not to buy something.

Here are a few guiding principles.

● For starters, every website benefits from having these foundational pages:
○ Homepage
○ About
○ Contact
○ Products/services (a high-level product overview/category page as well as
individual product pages if you have multiple products)
○ Privacy policy
○ Terms of service
● Some other pages worth creating:
○ Testimonials/reviews
○ Case studies
○ FAQ
○ Return/refunds
○ Shipping
● Create a landing page for each of your offerings. Your offerings don’t only include
your product; they could be your newsletter, a product demo, or special discount.
Each of these deserves a dedicated landing page with more information.
● After you’ve set up your website’s foundational pages, create more detailed
pages, like about each of your product’s core features or served industries. This
is a commonly missed SEO opportunity because many users search for a very
specific feature or offering that a high-level product features page can’t rank well
for. More detailed landing pages expand your company’s online presence.
○ For example, Zoho has separate pages about how its CRM can be used
by companies of different sizes and in different industries, plus employees
in different roles.
On-page SEO
On-page SEO refers to the optimization techniques used in your site’s content and
HTML source code. This category of techniques is necessary whenever you create a
new piece of content for your site, whether it’s a sales page or a blog post.

Here are some of the highest-leverage areas to focus on:

● Keywords
● Links
● Jump links
● Images
● Author bios and about pages
Keywords
Keywords are one of the most misunderstood aspects of SEO.

A few years ago, many websites repeated their target keywords throughout their pages
for higher SERP rankings. This strategy, called keyword stuffing, no longer works
because Google’s algorithms have evolved to use natural language processing; they
don’t just match search queries with content based on keywords.

That said, research shows content tends to do better in search results when its target
keyword is included in some important locations. These include:

● Your page URL
● Title tag
● Meta description
● Subheadings
● Body content
For info about keyword research for content creation, check out our Editorial/SEO
lesson.

URL
A URL that accurately describes what content on your page is about helps both humans
and search engines. Here’s the ideal format:

http://www.example.com/category-keyword/subcategory-keyword/primary-keyword
Keep it simple and concise, and separate keywords with hyphens. Below are a few
examples.

Well-optimized URLs

● https://www.minted.com/wedding-ideas/envelopes-101
● https://www.toms.com/us/men/shoes/boots
● https://www.zapier.com/blog/content-marketing-on-medium/
Poorly optimized URLs

● https://www.yeti.com/en_US/bags/backpacks/panga/28l/26010000003.html
● https://www.wayfair.com/home-improvement/sb0/indoor-fireplaces-c1875506.htm

other-rooms-eg-kitchen-disable-rates-on-websites-property-sharing-between-acc
ounts
Title tag
A title tag is the HTML snippet that specifies a web page’s title on SERPs.

Including your target keyword in the title tag helps both search engines and humans
understand what your page is about. But all of your competitors will do the same, so you
need to find ways to make your title more interesting and get users to click. Consider
adding some emotion—but don’t go overboard and write clickbait.

Some examples:

● How to Learn SEO (and Stay Sane)
● 18 Tips & Tricks to Master the Art of HR Management
● 8 Best Speed Reading Courses to 4x Your WPM
Ideally, title tags should be under 60 characters so they aren’t cut off. Use Moz’s Title
Tag Preview tool to see how yours will appear.

Meta description
The meta description is the longer snippet of info that appears underneath the title tag in
SERPs. You can set it yourself, but Google often generates its own description to show
more relevance to a user’s query.

Like your title tag, focus on writing compelling copy that attracts users’ attention. Think
of the description as an organic ad to encourage clicks. Don’t repeat the same
description across multiple pages.

Subheadings
Subheadings are the section headers that break up your content, formatted like so:

They’re arranged in a hierarchy, with a single h1 as the title of your content, then h2s at
the top, followed by h3s, h4s, and so on. (Not to be confused with the title tag, the h1
tag doesn’t appear in SERPs.)

Don’t stuff your keywords into every subheading. Instead, think of your content and
target keywords from a reader’s perspective and in terms of your content’s usability.
Where does it make sense to naturally include your target keywords? What related
keywords help support what your content is about?

For example, HubSpot’s high-ranking post about customer experience uses this
structure:

● How to Improve Customer Experience (h1)
○ What impacts the customer experience? (h2)
○ How to Improve Customer Experience in 8 Steps (h2)
■ 1. Illustrate the customer journey (h3)
■ 2. Equip and uplift your employees (h3)
■ 3. Audit the customer experience from multiple internal
perspectives. (h3)
■ Marketing (h4)
■ Sales (h4)
■ Customer Service (h4)
■ 4. Dedicate a clear focus on this initiative.
■ And so on...
Body content
As with the other page elements mentioned above, you should include your keywords
naturally in your body content.

There’s no such thing as an ideal keyword density. Instead, focus on creating thorough
and genuinely helpful content about your target keyword—what users are reasonably
looking for in their query.

Links
Links are a central part of SEO. From an on-page perspective, you should include both
internal and external links within your content.

● Internal links: These links direct users to another page on your site.
● External links: Also known as outbound links, these links direct users off of your
site.
Internal links help define your site’s hierarchy and architecture by telling Google which
web pages are most important on your site. For example, a link to your homepage in
your navigation menu and footer on every page shows that it’s more important than your
blog posts.

From a usability perspective, internal links also help keep users on your site for longer.
Ideally, visitors would explore and browse through your content rather than navigate
elsewhere.

To get internal link suggestions, use Ahrefs Site Audit’s Link opportunities feature. It
shows relevant anchor text on your site that could be linked to another
page—encouraging users to continue browsing your site.

Image credit: Ahrefs
Your website shouldn’t only have internal links, though. Link externally to helpful
references and trustworthy resources related to your content. These enhance your site’s
authority and also help Google understand what your content is about.

Anchor text
Link optimization depends not just on where links take users, but also the actual text
used, known as anchor text.

A few tips for optimizing your anchor text:

● Choose text that accurately describes the page you’re linking to. Avoid generic
text like “click here” as well as misleading text that doesn’t match the page you
link to.
● Don’t insert too many keywords or repeatedly link to a single page with the same
set of keywords. This “keyword-rich” anchor text looks suspicious or spammy to
Google.
● Keep your anchor text concise. A few words is fine; a whole sentence is
unnecessary.
Nofollow links and other attributes
For links with special circumstances, you can add relationship attributes in their HTML
tags. These attributes tell Google which links are deserving of something called link
equity.

Link equity describes the value that links pass from one page to another, like a currency
that Google uses to understand which sites are good quality. Google awards the most
link equity to web pages that naturally earn links without asking or paying for
them—we’ll dive into this in more detail in our lesson about off-page SEO.

You usually add attributes to external links that you’ve included in your content because
of special circumstances:

● Sponsored: Links that you were paid to include.
○ Example: <a href=”https://www.example.com/product”
rel=”sponsored”>company name</a>
● UGC: UGC, short for “user-generated content,” describes content created by
users rather than the site owner, like blog post comments. Depending on your
CMS, you may not need to add this tag to links of this nature. For example,
WordPress automatically adds the “ugc” attribute to comments with links.
○ Example: <a href=”https://www.example.com/product” rel=”ugc”>user
comment</a>
● Nofollow: Links that you’d rather Google not associate your site with or crawl the
linked page from. Marking a link as nofollow means that less link equity will flow
through it.
○ Example: <a href=”https://www.example.com/product”
rel=”nofollow”>suspicious company</a>
You can use multiple attributes for a single link.

Important note: Link attributes also apply to external links that point to your site, known
as inbound links. While a nofollow link to your site tells Google not to pass link equity,
it’s not bad for your site. Many case studies show that nofollow inbound links can
positively impact a website’s SEO. For some top-ranking content, as much as 20% to
40% of their backlink profiles are nofollow links.

To find out whether a link on any website has any relationship attributes, highlight its
anchor text, right click, and select Inspect to look at its source code.

Jump links
Whenever possible, include jump links in your content. These are internal links that take
users to a specific part of a web page. You can create them by assigning that specific
location with an ID and using a # in your link:

<a id="link-destination">where your link takes users</a>
<a href="#link-destination">jump link</a>
Jump links are often used in tables of contents and make your content more easily
navigable, especially long pieces of content. Check out how Buffer formats its guides
with a sticky table of contents.

From an SEO perspective, jump links help tell Google what your content is about. They
may also appear in SERPs, giving additional info to users and making your content
more enticing.

Another perk of including jump links, specifically in a table of contents: You can use a
heat mapping tool like Hotjar to find out where users are clicking most often. Based on
this info, you could reorganize your content to place this info more prominently, or add
CTAs to those specific sections.

Images
Images (and other forms of media like video) make a website more engaging than if it
were purely text, but you need to optimize these assets for a better page experience.
Here’s how.

● Resize your images. Large images slow down your site. If you don’t plan on
displaying full-sized images at 4000 x 3000 pixels, make them smaller.
● Compress image file size. Not to be confused with image size, image file size
refers to the amount of space needed to store an image. This can affect your site
speed. To maintain a fast loading speed, compress your images using
Photoshop’s “Save for the web” option or TinyPNG.
○ When should you use JPEGS over PNGs and vice versa? JPEGs usually
offer better compression levels than other file formats, so they’re best for
images with opaque backgrounds, like photographs. PNG allows for
transparency and higher image quality, but generally come with a larger
file size; they’re ideal for logos, graphs, and illustrations.
● Give your images descriptive file names. A descriptive file name helps search
crawlers understand its subject matter better than something like “IMG_97950” or
another default name. Use hyphens to separate words, like
automatic-timer-feature.png.
● Write descriptive alt text. Alt text (short for “alternative text”) is the snippet of
information included in an image’s HTML code. When an image fails to load, the
alt tag is what appears. Screen readers also read alt text to let users with visual
impairments know what’s in it. It gives context to images’ subject matter and like
file names, helps search engine crawlers index images correctly.
●
● Image credit: SE Ranking
● Choose original images over stock photos. Research shows that sites with
original images tend to outrank sites that rely on stock photos. So whenever
possible, opt for creating and using your own images rather than ones used by
other sites.
Author bios and about pages
Google looks at a website’s E-A-T—the expertise, authoritativeness, and
trustworthiness of its creator—to evaluate its quality. This is why articles from Mayo
Clinic rank higher than no-name websites prescribing unverified medical advice.

Some SEOs have observed that including author bios with their degrees/certifications
can lead to a ranking boost. This doesn’t mean Google ranks sites based on author
reputation, though. It’s possible users viewed a site more credibly and were more likely
to share it if author info was included.

The point here: Author info provides transparency to readers and builds your brand’s
credibility.

Even if you don’t have a specialized degree, having an author bio builds trust—more
than an authorless piece of content would. Google’s Quality Rater Guidelines even
acknowledge that not all topics require formal expertise. For example, detailed
restaurant or product reviews can be high quality even if they don’t come from food
critics or product experts.

Technical SEO
On-page SEO also includes technical SEO , website and server optimizations that help
search engine crawlers understand and index your websites’ content more easily. The

goal is to optimize for Google’s Core Web Vitals, the factors Google considers most
important in a website’s user experience:

● Loading: How fast it takes for your page to load
● Interactivity: How long it takes for users to interact with your content, like
clicking on your navigation menu
● Visual stability: Whether elements on your page move around as it loads
(ideally, they don’t)
Technical SEO isn’t just for satisfying search engines. The idea behind the Core Web
Vitals is that users enjoy and benefit most from websites that are fast, clear, and easy to
use.

Some of the earlier on-page tactics we discussed also optimize for these vitals, like
image optimization. However, in this lesson, we’ll cover more technical tactics:

● HTTPS
● Indexability
● Mobile usability
● Robots.txt file
● Schema markup
Heads up: Some of these tactics require advanced web development skills—you may
not be able to handle them without a developer or technical SEO specialist. Still, you
should read this section to develop an understanding of what needs to be done on the
technical side; this will set you up to vet potential hires and identify candidates that
really know their stuff.

Oftentimes you can hire a freelance developer or technical SEO specialist to help
execute these tactics on a project basis, and then do a periodic technical SEO audit a
few times a year. These issues don’t usually require constant attention.

The exception here is large websites that are programmatically driven—for example,
marketplaces like Poshmark or Airbnb. These tend to require more ongoing SEO
maintenance, in which case we recommend hiring an inhouse technical SEO specialist.

Whether inhouse or freelance, if you don’t already have these resources, ask around
your network or a paid community like Traffic Think Tank for recommendations. Or
advertise your job posting to a more targeted community like Demand Curve’s job
board. With platforms like Upwork, you often need to sift through a lot of low-quality
candidates—and if you’re not a technical SEO expert yourself, it’s not always clear
who’s actually qualified.

HTTPS
Take a look at how these two URLs appear in your browser:

The difference is HTTPS, an internet communication protocol that protects the data
shared between a user and a website. The alternative, an HTTP connection, is less
secure.

Google announced HTTPS as a ranking signal in 2014. Apart from its SEO benefits,
using HTTPS also enhances the user experience by making visitors more comfortable
on your site. You can set it up for your site with an SSL certificate, which is often offered
by your web host.

For example, with DreamHost, you can see which sites aren’t secure under the Manage
Domains option.

Click on the site you want to secure; then follow the prompts to activate it.

If your web host doesn’t offer SSL certificates, get one from a Certificate Authority like
GoDaddy or Namecheap. You’ll need to install it yourself, but whatever authority you get
it from will provide instructions about this process.

Indexability
Search engine crawlers visit web pages to analyze their content and then store them in
Google’s index. It’s these indexed pages that appear in SERPs—so if your content isn’t
indexed, it won’t show up in search results.

To find out whether your site has any indexability issues, use GSC. Click Coverage
(under Index) in the sidebar. It’ll show any non-indexed pages as errors.

To find out if a specific page has been indexed, you can look it up using GSC’s URL
Inspection Tool.

If a page isn’t indexed, the URL Inspection Tool will tell you. Click the Request Indexing
button to bring it to Google’s attention. You can also do this for pages that are already
indexed but that have been updated recently.

Mobile-first indexing
With more and more users browsing content on their phones, Google has shifted to
mobile-first indexing.

What this means: Google crawls and indexes sites’ mobile versions. You can confirm
this in GSC’s Coverage report, which shows how Google crawls your site.

For most businesses, this won’t cause major problems. It’s a bigger concern for
websites that have very different desktop and mobile versions—for example, less
content on their mobile site or different URLs (www.example.com vs. m.example.com).

If you do hide content on your mobile site or use separate URLs for a mobile and
desktop version, stop. Work with your developer to ensure that your content is the same
on both mobile and desktop.

Mobile usability
While your website content should be the same on both mobile and desktop, it should
be just as accessible on mobile as it is on desktop. This is the concept of mobile
usability, which is separate from mobile-first indexing.

It’s not about having the same exact appearance on different devices. Rather, making
your site mobile-friendly means visitors can easily navigate it and read content despite
viewing it on a smaller screen.

Use Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test to find out whether your site is mobile-friendly. Bring
up any identified issues with your web developer.

Some tactics for better usability:

● Use a responsive web design. Responsive designs adapt content to the device
it’s being viewed on—for example, landscape-orientation pages become oriented
for portrait, and images automatically resize. This way, users don’t have to pinch
and zoom.
○ Many CMS platforms like WordPress offer responsive site themes so you
don’t necessarily need a developer’s help here. Rather, switch to a
responsive theme for your site.
● Disable intrusive pop-ups on mobile. These are the pop-ups that cover
content and must be dismissed before users can read your page. Most pop-up
plugins have smart targeting that let you specify where these show. Non-intrusive
pop-ups, like slide-ins, are preferred since they don’t disrupt the user experience.
● Improve page speed. A slow user experience makes it harder for users to find
what they’re looking for on your site. We’ve covered a few tactics like
compressing your images to improve page speed, but there are more technical
aspects like removing unnecessary scripts from your site’s source code.
○ Use Google’s PageSpeed Insights to analyze your site’s speed, and be
sure to check both your mobile and desktop score. You can also use
Lighthouse for detailed recommendations. This information is quite
technical, so it’s best to review this with a developer.
Robots.txt file
Robots.txt is a text file that instructs search crawlers how to crawl your site. It’s used to
disallow web pages, which tells Googlebot to focus elsewhere.

Most websites don’t need a robots.txt file, especially new companies just starting out. It
makes the most sense for sites with more than 10,000 unique pages that change
frequently—at least once a week or more often.

For these larger, frequently changing sites, a robots.txt file helps Googlebot prioritize
which content to crawl. You’d disallow less important content that users don’t need to

see in SERPs, like your staging site, filtered product category pages, and internal
search results pages.

You can create a robots.txt file by using a free robots.txt generator like this one from
SEO Book. Once complete, upload the robots.txt file to your site’s root domain.

Schema markup
Schema markups (also known as structured data) are snippets of code that, when
added to your web pages, give Google more information about how to represent your
content in SERPs. You’ve no doubt seen them before.

Several types exist, and you can find more details about each on schema.org.

There’s no evidence that schema directly affects SEO—but it does improve user
experience. How so? It gives visitors more insight about your content, which can then

encourage them to actually click on your site. For example, a user looking for a specific
item might be motivated to click on a result after seeing product schema that indicates
it’s currently in stock.

Not as many websites as you might expect actually use schema, so adding it can make
your content leave a stronger impression on users and improve clickthrough. We
especially recommend adding the following schema:

● FAQ: Add this markup to not only your actual FAQ page but also your product
and service pages. By addressing user objections and concerns, this schema
gives more readers info than your meta description on its own.
● Product/offer: This schema shows price and availability. If your competitors
don’t use it, it’s a quick way for your page to stand out. If they do use it, it helps
users quickly compare products from different search results.
● Ratings and reviews: This schema functions as social proof. A search result
with obviously good ratings and reviews is a lot more enticing than one without
any of this information.
● Video: Since this schema enables a video thumbnail in SERPs, your content
gets a visual element that text-only search results lack.
To set up schema markup, use Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper or another free
online generator like TechnicalSEO.com’s. These tools walk you through the markup
process and then provide a code to be added to a specific page’s HTML code.

Off-page SEO
Unlike on-page SEO, off-page SEO revolves around actions taken outside of your site
to improve perceptions of it as a quality resource. Remember that Google looks at a
website’s E-A-T to evaluate its quality—and one of the major signals here is a website’s
backlink profile , all of the external links that point to your site.

Why do backlinks matter? Two practical reasons:

● Link equity: Content receiving more backlinks generally receives more link
equity. Just like how the strongest research papers get the most citations,
Google’s PageRank algorithm views websites that receive more backlinks as
better quality.
● Referral traffic: The more backlinks to your site exist on other sites, the more
potential sources of referral traffic you’ll have. Users will have more ways of
finding your site than through search alone.
A link that points to your site from another is a vote of confidence for your content,
though not all links are equal. Links pass more equity from relevant, authoritative
resources, not spammy sites filled only with keywords and links. Additionally, links that
give more link equity are placed somewhere central, like in a blog post’s body content
rather than the footer.

Since links play such an important role in SEO, getting links (“ link building ”) from other
sites is a major part of SEO strategies—especially new sites trying to get more traction.
We’ll get into more specific link building tactics, but first, you need to know:

● How to find your website’s backlink profile
● How low-quality links affect your SEO
Important note: Link building is a tactic to improve your content’s search performance,
but it should never be your biggest or only SEO priority. In other words, there’s more to
SEO than just links. If your link building efforts aren’t working, it may be that your
content is objectively bad—and you need to improve it before other sites even consider
linking to it.

How to find your website’s backlink
profile
GSC gives basic data about your backlink profile under Links in the sidebar, like which
of your pages has received the most external links.

But for a more detailed backlink audit, look up your website in Ahrefs’ Site Explorer.

Click on the number under Referring domains to find out which sites link to yours, or the
Backlinks number to find out the individual linking pages. In the results page, Ahrefs
even includes the date each backlink is detected.

(You can do this to not only find out your website’s backlink profile but your competitors’
as well—a great way to do competitive SEO analysis.)

Measuring website quality
Ahrefs also shows a few different ranking scores, like DR, short for Domain Rating. This
is specific to Ahrefs and measures a website’s quality based on its backlink profile.

Most SEO tools have their own version of this; for example, Semrush uses Authority
Score (AS) and Moz uses Domain Authority (DA). They’re helpful for gauging which
websites to prioritize for link building. No matter which metric you use, the higher the
score, the better—so ideally, when given the option, you’d want a link from a site with a
high DR than a low one.

You should avoid obsessing over improving this score for your site or only getting links
from sites of a certain DR, though. These rankings are useful for understanding what
sites are authoritative but in the end, they’re vanity metrics created by other companies.

Topical relevance—that is, whether a site covers the same topics as yours—is just as
important. A link from a low-DR website in your niche tends to benefit your SEO more
than a high-DR website in a completely different industry.

Low-quality links
Over time, your website will probably get low-quality links, like from spammy, low-DR
websites that scrape content. This is inevitable; even the most reputable sites have bad
links in their backlink profile.

While these links aren’t ideal, they’re generally not an issue for your site’s SEO. Google
can recognize spammy links and won’t penalize your site unless there’s an excessive
amount of them—for example, if they outnumber high-quality links.

This could happen if a competitor practices negative SEO, which involves building a lot
of spammy links to your site. In this case, you can use Google’s Disavow tool to tell
Google to ignore these links.

But for most sites, poor links won’t negatively impact your SEO. There’s rarely a need to
disavow links.

Link building overview
Link building is hard. But with more industry connections and a stronger brand
reputation, it becomes easier because people link to your content organically. Later on,
you may not need to spend as much time building links (unless you find new
competitors edging your site out of the top rankings).

For new companies starting out, though, there are rarely any shortcuts for going about
link building. You can pay for backlinks from other sites, but this is considered black hat
SEO. Google’s guidelines classify paid links as link schemes , which also includes
using other forms of payment like:

● Exchanging goods or services for links
● Sending someone a "free" product in exchange for a link
● Trading links between different websites
Still, many agencies and freelance SEO consultants offer paid link-building services,
with a wide spectrum in both price and quality. These include:

● Link building platforms (e.g., FAT JOE, Stan Ventures), usually run by agencies.
You buy links from them just as you would order something off Amazon.
● Link exchanges, where you pay a website directly to get a backlink to your
content included.
● Professional link builders—agencies or independent consultants and writers who
act like PR specialists for SEO. They pitch and write content for established sites
to get a backlink to your site.
Generally, all charge higher prices for links from more authoritative websites. And while
they all fall under the link scheme category, their execution varies.

Some paid links are purely transactional, resulting in irrelevant or low-quality links. For
example, someone places your link about CRM software on a site about cars. Other
paid links are more thoughtful and deliberate, like a link from a blog post that covers the
same topic your content addresses.

The reality: it’s possible to pay for high-quality links without getting penalized by Google.
The bigger factor here is the quality of link building services you pay for.

Quality link builders invest a lot of time in finding relevant websites that actually benefit
from a link to your site; they don’t force unnatural links on unrelated sites. Because of
this, they cost a lot, charging as much as $5,000 for 10 links. It may make sense to

keep this function inhouse, but if this isn’t possible, here’s how you can vet link building
services:

Look at their testimonials or case studies. Specifically, look for familiar brands
that have worked with them.
○ Many companies are secretive about using paid link services, so you
probably won’t see major brand names. But you may recognize mid-sized
companies, which tend to give more reliable testimonials than small,
unknown businesses that don’t understand SEO so well.
Cross-check these clients’ SEO performance using Ahrefs’ Site Explorer. Do they
rank on the first page of SERPs for any keywords? If so, what keywords? How
relevant are these keywords to the client?
Choose a link building service that’s worked with recognizable companies that
have high-ranking content. If an established company with good SEO can vouch
for this service, it’s a good sign it delivers relevant and authoritative links.
Link building strategies
We classify inbound links into three categories:

Owned: Acquired through channels and accounts you have control over.
○ Example: You create a profile for your company on G2 and add a link to
your site.
Acquired: Acquired through deliberate effort.
○ Example: You submit a guest column to TechCrunch and include a
relevant link to your blog post.
Organic: Naturally given to your site without any effort from you.
○ Example: Another website links to your graphic design tutorial in a blog
post.
You can increase your chances of getting organic links by creating fantastic
content—but beyond content creation, these links are generally out of your control.
Because of this, we’ll focus on strategies for building owned and acquired links.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the tactics we’ll get into. (Note that this is a non-exhaustive
list. Many other link building strategies exist, but we’ve focused on the most effective
ones based on our experience.)

Strategy Type Difficulty
Directories and review sites Owned Easy
Forums Owned Moderate
Search ads Acquired Moderate
Online communities Acquired Moderate
Cold outreach Acquired Hard
Guest posting Acquired Hard
HARO Acquired Hard
Some of the tactics covered here are also discussed in our Content Marketing module’s
Distribution lesson. That’s because more broadly, link-building is a form of content
distribution—it’s done to promote your content, although specifically with SEO in mind.

Which link building strategies should you prioritize?

Some of the advice from our Distribution lesson also applies here—specifically, the
recommendation that you leverage existing relationships first. So when you’re reading
through these link building tactics, consider:

● Do you have any relationships with other brands, e.g., parent/sister companies,
an incubator?
● Do you know any employees at another company in your industry?
● Do you know any journalists or freelance writers who write about your industry?
● What online communities are you active in?
Just like it makes more sense to ask someone you know for a favor instead of a
stranger, your existing relationships provide a better starting point for building links.

Owned link building activities
Directories and review sites
Online directories and review sites are low-hanging fruit for link building, requiring
relatively low time and effort. These include websites like:

● Capterra
● Clutch
● Crunchbase
● G2
● Glassdoor
● SaaSHub
● StackShare
● Trustpilot
● TrustRadius
Create a profile for your company on these sites. Then fill in your company’s details,
including a link to your site.

You can easily find more review sites by searching the name of a well-known software
and “reviews” in Google. For example:

Compared to other link-building strategies, it’s easy to get backlinks from these sites,
though they tend to be nofollow. Google is also aware of how directories and review
sites have been used for link building, so these links don’t pass as much link equity as
other sites. Still, getting listed on them is valuable as a source of referral traffic; it also
legitimizes your brand to users.

Forums
Forums are another owned link-building channel that provides limited link equity but can
help drive more users to your site.

Potential forums and communities include:

● Reddit
● Quora
● Hacker News
● Indie Hackers
Focus on those that actually connect to your brand and industry, and review each
community’s guidelines before posting. And when you do post, do so meaningfully.
Engage with other users by writing thoughtful comments and asking questions—don’t
include a link to your content in every post. Some observant users, particularly those on
Reddit, will call out posts that come off as overly promotional or self-serving.

Consider how this marketer at Ahrefs writes helpful Quora answers. They often link to
Ahrefs but in an educational, not salesy, way.

However, we find that you can talk about your brand and share its content without
backlash if you’re upfront about it. Eric Bandholz, the founder of the ecommerce shop
Beardbrand, does this on Reddit.

Acquired link building activities
Search ads
For any new site, getting traffic (much less links) to newly published content can be an
uphill battle. A strategy worth testing to accelerate this is running search ads to the page

you want to build backlinks to. Since search ads appear at the top of SERPs, running
ads can help get these pages more traffic—and potentially more links.

Why this can work:

● Most companies running ads are competing for keywords with strong purchase
intent, usually directing users to sales pages.
● This tactic does the opposite: going after keywords with low purchase intent
(which tend to be cheaper and less competitive) and directing users to a
non-salesy piece of content.
The content that’s most likely to succeed in this strategy tends to be comprehensive and
educational, like a long roundup of statistics. The idea here is that a reporter or blogger
in need of this information would search for the target keyword and click on your
content, which, thanks to Google Ads, appears at the top of SERPs. Then they’d link to
it.

You can learn about how to set up Google Ads in our Search Ads unit. Here’s an
example of companies using this strategy to target the phrase “remote work statistics.”

This isn’t a foolproof strategy, but something to test with a live ads campaign for 1-3
months. You shouldn’t expect to get backlinks immediately, as writers may go through a
long editorial process before their content gets published.

So after your ad campaign finishes, check your backlinks using Ahrefs. Then check
again after three months for any additional backlinks.

It’s impossible to find out the true impact of your search ad and how many links it
earned. But some writers who linked to your page may have simply copied and pasted
your page’s URL, even including its Google Click ID (GCLID). This is a part of your ad
URL that, if included in a backlink, indicates that a user did indeed link to your page
from its ad.

Here’s how to check whether your ad URL has any backlinks:

Search your website in Ahrefs’ Site Explorer.
Click on the number under Backlinks.
In the Backlinks results page, filter for backlinks that include “gclid”. We’ve done
this with Employment Hero, one of the websites that created an ad for “remote
work statistics” in our earlier example.
Looking through the backlink results, it’s clear Employment Hero has used this strategy
for several non-sales pages—and it’s worked! The fact that backlinks include the GCLID
parameter indicate people are linking to the ad page. Still, this doesn’t paint the full
picture of how many links your ads have gotten, because some writers will clean up the
URL before linking to it in their content.

While this strategy costs money, it may generate links for a lower price than you’d
otherwise pay with a professional link builder. For example, if you spent $500 on Google
Ads and discovered four links to your target page, that’s about $125/link—much
cheaper than services charging $300-$500 per link.

Cold outreach
One of the most straightforward and yet difficult ways to get a backlink to your content:
asking for it. This is usually done through cold email outreach to webmasters and
influencers. It’s most effective when you have:

Amazing content: Content that’s clearly superior to other existing content about
the same topic, e.g., because it provides more examples or detail.
Connections to other webmasters: You know other people that create content
in your niche.
Without either, cold outreach often doesn’t have very good ROI. Personalized outreach
can lead to better results, but this is time-intensive. Automation platforms like
BuzzStream make it possible to send hundreds of customized emails for link building,
but still, the success rate of these is usually quite low.

The skyscraper technique , a strategy named by Brian Dean, relies heavily on creating
excellent content, regardless of your connections with other sites. Using this technique,
companies create better content than what already exists—for example, producing a
more thorough and detailed guide than a leading competitor’s. Then they reach out to
sites linking to the existing, inferior content to ask for a link.

Image credit: Backlinko
Though this strategy can work, there’s no guarantee. If the existing content they’ve
linked to is still helpful, some of the sites you contact simply won’t be inclined to switch
links.

This reflects one of the biggest challenges of cold outreach as a link-building strategy: it
often comes across as one-sided. Many webmasters understand that giving a link to
whoever’s reaching out benefits the other party more—so you generally need to give
more reason as to why they should link to your content.

Broken link building is a strategy intended to do exactly that. Using this tactic, you
identify web pages that are relevant to your content and have broken links—links that
direct to error pages because the original page no longer exists. You then reach out to
the webmaster to suggest linking to your resource, since the broken link provides no
value to readers.

Example: If a website had a broken link to a now-deleted resource about project
management, you could suggest replacing it with a link to your guide about project
management best practices.

Here’s what a broken link building email might look like.

Image credit: Backlinko
The difficulty with this strategy is identifying broken links about topics that your website
also covers. We advise using Ahrefs:

Look up similar websites in your industry, like your competitors, in Site Explorer.
Select the Best by links option under Pages in the sidebar.
At the top of the results, filter for “404 not found” in the HTTP code dropdown.
Here you’ll see broken URLs on the website you’ve searched, plus the number of
websites that link to this broken page (under Referring domains).
Because these pages are broken, you won’t know what kind of content they
offered—but the URL slug often gives a big clue. For example, in the screenshot
above, the second result was most likely a blog post about sales copywriting
techniques relying on human psychology.
Look for URLs that cover topics you also have content about. So if you also have
a guide about sales copywriting techniques on your site, it may make sense to
target any websites that link to the broken post mentioned earlier.
Click the number under the Dofollow column in the row of the broken link you
want to target. This will show you a Backlinks report listing the pages that
currently link to that URL (which actually leads users to a 404 error page) and do
not have a nofollow tag.
These are the sites you could reach out to and suggest your content as a
replacement for. Not all sites will be a good fit—you’ll have to look at each page
and the context (also shown under the Anchor and backlink column) to see
which make sense to contact. Avoid reaching out to sites in another language or
that are clearly spammy (for example, they have a low DR and use keyword-rich
anchor text).
It’s worth exporting this data as a spreadsheet to track which sites to reach out
to. You can also use it to compile the contact information for each site (use a tool
like Hunter.io for more efficiency).
The broken link strategy can work, but there’s no guarantee. Sometimes instead of
linking to your suggested page, webmasters simply remove the broken link.

...Which is why you might instead try offering something of value.

Note that according to Google’s guidelines, explicitly offering something in exchange for
a link counts as a link scheme. So when using this strategy, people generally take a
no-strings-attached approach, offering something of value but not asking for an outright
trade.

For example, here’s an email pitch that not only gives valid reasons for why a link to
their content would make sense, but also offers several goodies—regardless of whether
the recipient does give a backlink.

For this strategy, here’s how to find websites to reach out to.

In Google, search for your target keyword. The top search results are likely
competitors. Their content may resemble yours, although ideally, yours should be
better. (Otherwise, sites would rather link to whatever’s ranking at the top of
SERPs.)
Choose one of the competitor results—one that your content is clearly superior
to. You’re going to be suggesting that other websites link to your page instead of
this competitor.
Enter its URL into Ahrefs’ Site Explorer. Click on the number under Backlinks.
A list of pages that link to this URL will appear. Look at each page and the link
context (shown under the Anchor and backlink column) to see which sites are
worth reaching out to.
Whether you use the broken link building strategy or offer something more tangible in
your outreach, you also need to write good outreach emails. Our Cold Outreach module
teaches how to write more effective emails for the purpose of lead generation, but you
can apply the same principles to outreach emails asking for a backlink.

Guest posting
Guest posts are blog posts written for another company’s website, often with a backlink
to the author’s site. There may be a link in the author bio as well as a link in the guest
post’s actual body.

Many SEO strategies focus on guest posting on reputable, high-authority websites
related to their industry. These sites drive stronger link equity as well as relevant traffic.

For example, if your product is an accounting software, it would make sense to write a
guest post about small business accounting tips for a business site. You could include a
link to your homepage as well as a related blog post on your site for interested readers
that want to learn more.

While guest posts help establish your company’s authority, getting them published is
often a time-consuming process that involves:

● Searching for relevant sites to guest post on (we walk through this process in our
Content Distribution project)
● Pitching article ideas, often via email
● Drafting and editing the guest post
● Additional edits or revisions based on feedback from the other site
To find relevant sites that accept guest posts, Google your industry, plus keywords
about guest posting. For example:

● Startup “guest post”
● Startup "write for us"
● Startup "contributor guidelines"
● Startup “writing guidelines”
Use quotation marks around the keywords you only want exact matches for. The
phrases above are often used in the context of guest posting.

Most sites have specific guest posting guidelines that detail what kind of content they’re
looking for; not all may be a good match for your site. Read through these guidelines
and also look up each site in Ahrefs to find out their DR. Prioritize guest posting on sites
that have a higher DR, ideally at least 50. (Use the spreadsheet template from our
Content Distribution project to track these guest posting sites.)

Once you’ve identified relevant sites to guest post for, follow their process for pitching or
submitting content. Oftentimes websites ask for a detailed pitch via email or through a
form, with very specific instructions like what to write in the subject line. Follow these
instructions closely—otherwise, your guest post pitch may be ignored.

In this way, cold outreach is also a part of guest posting, though you’re offering to write
an article for another website’s audience rather than simply asking for a backlink. The

same principles hold here: you’ll get the best results with more personalized emails that
clearly convey how you, or your post, will bring value.

Many sites also ask for samples of your other content to judge whether or not to accept
a guest post from you. Unless you’ve already published other content online, send over
well-written blog posts from your site that relate to the guest posting site.

Over time, successful guest posting has a snowball effect for your own credibility as an
author. If you get published on any reputable sites like HubSpot, include them in your
guest post pitch.

Here’s an example of a successful pitch email.

What makes this pitch effective?

● Besides providing writing samples, it also offers SEO data about how the writer’s
past guest posts performed. Webmasters know that people want to write guest
posts for a link—but that doesn’t mean the guest posts they receive are always
good. Including data from Semrush gives the guest post editor more confidence
that this writer can provide real value to their site.
● The writer makes it clear they researched the guest post site with their suggested
topics. This comes across in the line, “I did a quick site search and it doesn’t look
like your site has much content about either topic.”
Guest posting can be time- and resource-intensive—but done well, it gets more link
equity and referral traffic for your site. You may also benefit from networking with other
companies; webmasters pleased with your guest posts might invite you to submit
another guest post later on.

A few tactics for making your guest posting strategy more efficient:

● Leverage any existing connections for a guest post first. If you know people
at other companies in your niche, ask about writing an article for their site. Or,
ask any link partners you’ve worked with if you can submit a guest post.
● Outsource your guest posts to skilled writers. Once you’ve successfully
pitched guest post ideas, hire freelance writers in your niche to draft them. Edit
as needed and then submit them. Doing this lets you focus on the pitching
process to get more articles published on other sites.
● Write guest posts about topics already covered by your long-form articles.
This strategy saves time on ideating and researching completely new topics to
write guest posts about. For example, Ahrefs creates detailed, long-form guides
for its own blog—then creates shorter guest posts using the same research to
pitch to other sites.
HARO
Major publishers and outlets use Help A Reporter Out (HARO) to get quotes from
industry experts for their articles. (There’s also Help a B2B Writer—the same concept,
but with a focus on B2B industries.) You can sign up as a source and contribute your
insights to get cited with ideally, a link to your site—although there’s no guarantee.

Signing up as a source will get you regular HARO emails with journalist queries like
these:

Queries relevant to your product make good opportunities for getting a backlink from an
established website—but you need to write clear, thoughtful responses to increase your
chances of being quoted. The goal isn’t to sell your product; it’s to get a brand mention
and link from a high-authority site.

The best way to use HARO:

● Sign up for queries from industries that relate to yours. (Signing up for irrelevant
industries will mean more emails and queries to filter through.)
● Selectively choose queries that you’re qualified to answer or can offer a
genuinely valuable perspective on. Don’t answer queries that are only loosely
connected to your product. Journalists using HARO receive dozens of responses
and tend to prefer quoting only the most relevant sources.
● Set up a Google alert for your name as well as your brand’s. Journalists don’t
always share their published piece with the people they’ve quoted, so a Google
alert brings any newly published content quoting you or your company to your
attention.
● Keep a running doc with all of your HARO answers. Multiple journalists may seek
quotes on the same subject, so you can save time writing by repurposing and
tweaking previous responses.
● Use a spreadsheet to track the queries you’ve answered, when you responded,
the journalist submitting the query, and the publication a query is for.
○ You may see repeated queries from one journalist—if they’ve cited you
before, it’s worth mentioning this in your email. Work on building a rapport
with journalists; if they’ve enjoyed working with you, they may reach out to
you for future queries.
Here’s an example of a successful HARO response.

Not all HARO responses need to be so long, but effective responses are generally:

● Detailed. They thoroughly answer the question asked by the journalist.
● Novel. They provide new and meaningful insight that readers may not already
know or expect about a topic.
● Formatted for clarity. They’re easy to read because they use line breaks, bullet
points, and numbered lists. They may also emphasize key points with bolding or
underlining.
Remember to include a line about who you are and why your response matters—you
might relate this to your company. It’s OK to give a quick explanation of what you do, but
keep this short. The bulk of your email should be a response to the HARO query.

Online communities
Online communities are a potent source for acquiring links—specifically marketing
communities where most members have a basic understanding of SEO. Besides getting
links, these places are great for networking with other brands and potentially grabbing
organic backlinks in the future.

A few places worth joining:

● B2B Bloggers Boost Group
● Top of Funnel
● Online Geniuses
● Backlinks Slack Group
To find more, ask around your network. Search Facebook and Google for free marketing
groups.

Because these communities understand the importance of link building, their members
are often more transparent about what they’re looking for. You’ll generally see two types
of posts in these communities:

● Link suggestions: When someone shares a topic they’re writing about and asks
for relevant resources to link to.
● Link partnerships: People looking to build either one-time or ongoing link
building relationships with marketers from other sites.
Here’s an example of a post asking for link suggestions.

A request for link suggestions is an invitation to send over any links related to the
requester’s topic. Write a quick blurb about why your link would be a great resource for
their article to include; then send it through an email or Slack or Facebook message.

Alternatively, some people also collect quotes and links by setting up a Google form,
like so:

Link partnerships are more involved—and they fall into an iffy category between white
hat and black hat SEO. Think of them as an amplified form of guest posting.

When you enter a link partnership, both parties are expected to deliver links from other
sites. One way to understand how this works:

● Site A and Site B agree to a link partnership.
● Site A publishes a guest post on Site C. The guest post links to Site A as well as
Site B.
● Site B publishes a guest post on Site D. The guest post links to Site B as well as
Site A.
● Neither Site A nor Site B link to one another on their own sites.
These aren’t direct link trades, although they’re similarly transactional with the goal of
building links for the two partner sites involved. Some companies are involved in
multiple partnerships at once, creating a wide network of link builders that all lean on
one another.

Compared to traditional guest posts, link partnerships are more efficient. If you have
multiple link partners, one guest post could net as many backlinks as you have link
partners.

But these partnerships require extra coordination—both you and your partner must
communicate which of your content you’d like to build links to (your “target pages”).
Then you must find guest posting sites where you can write about a topic that naturally
links to not just your site, but also your partner’s.

Marketers often use a shared spreadsheet and email to track each partner’s target links
and successful guest posts.

Whether you go for link suggestions or partnerships or both, here’s how we advise
starting off in online communities:

Rather than making your own post, first look for posts from marketers working in
your niche.
Check other marketers’ sites using Ahrefs. Also take a look at their actual
website—is their content good? Would you find value in it as a consumer?
Respond to posts by marketers working with a high-DR site (>50) in an industry
that relates to yours. Be polite and cordial.
Besides getting backlinks, work on cultivating relationships with other marketers
and webmasters. This will open the door for other cross-promotion opportunities
later on.
A warning: Not all marketers in these communities follow ethical SEO practices. Avoid
those that make requests that blatantly violate Google’s guidelines, like asking for
reciprocal links.

SEO Roadmap
It’s hard to know where to start with an SEO content strategy, so we’ve put together this
roadmap for guidance. Use this to prioritize the different tasks needed to optimize your
site.

Website setup
● Buy a domain name for your website using a service like Namecheap, GoDaddy,
etc.
● Choose a hosting provider and/or platform like Webflow, DreamHost,
Squarespace, etc.
● Buy an SSL certificate for your site.
● Set up Google Analytics and Google Search Console (GSC).
● Plan out your site’s architecture in a Google Doc or on a sheet of paper. Map out
key pages for your site, as well as the high-level categories and subcategories
your pages will be organized under (including their URL structure). Use this map
to guide your landing page creation.
Content creation
● Conduct keyword research about your product, industry, and competitors. Use
this research to determine what keywords your site content should focus on and
optimize for; this applies to your product pages, blog content, etc. (Note that not
all pages need to target a specific keyword, e.g., your about page.)
● Create landing pages for:
○ About
○ Contact
○ Products/services (a high-level product overview/category page as well as
individual product pages if you have multiple products)
○ Privacy policy
○ Terms of service
● Consider creating additional pages for:
○ Each of your offerings—your newsletter, product demos, discounts, etc.
○ Product features
○ The industries your business serves
○ Testimonials/reviews
○ Case studies
○ FAQ
○ Return/refunds
○ Shipping policy
● If you’re pursuing an SEO content strategy, set up your site’s blog.
● Create valuable, original content for each landing page on your site. Refer to our
Content Writing Guidelines for best practices on content creation.
On-page SEO
● Use GSC to ensure that your website is indexed.
● Write engaging title tags and meta descriptions for each of your landing pages.
● Resize images and/or compress large image file sizes for faster loading times on
your site. Also give your images descriptive file names and alt text.
● Use Ahrefs to identify and fix broken links. Also use Ahrefs to identify internal link
opportunities.
● Add relevant schema markup using Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper.
● Determine how mobile-friendly your site is using Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test.
Consult with your developer or technical SEO specialist about optimizations to
improve mobile-friendliness.
● Check your site’s page speed using PageSpeed Insights. Consult with your
developer or technical SEO specialist about optimizations to improve page
speed.
● Audit your website periodically using Google Analytics, GSC, Ahrefs, Semrush,
or another similar tool. Track how your rankings for various keywords shift over
time. Revisit and make changes to poorly performing pages by:
○ Updating outdated information
○ Deleting old, irrelevant content
○ Adding internal links to orphaned pages
Off-page SEO
● Make a list of your available resources for link building in a Google Doc or on a
sheet of paper—this includes your budget and any relationships with other
brands, websites, or journalists. Use this list to determine which link-building
strategies to prioritize.
○ Example: If you know employees at other companies in your industry,
consider reaching out to ask if you can write a guest post for their
company’s blog.
● Create profiles for your company on relevant directories and review sites. Include
a link to your site in each profile.
● Identify forums and communities that are relevant to your product and/or industry.
Engage meaningfully with others for potential link-building opportunities—link
partnerships, guest posts, etc. Share links to any content on your website when
warranted; do not promote your site at every opportunity.
● Use Ahrefs to periodically audit your site’s backlink profile. Monitor how changes
in backlinks correspond with your site’s search performance.
Project: Keyword research
The goal of this project is to identify relevant keywords for your content marketing strategy.
Specifically, you’ll:

● Develop ideas for relevant topics to create content about
● Find out which topics users are actively searching for information about and how difficult
it is to create highly ranking content for each topic
● Organize keywords into topic clusters for easier prioritization
This project is best completed using a keyword research tool like Ahrefs and Semrush. We’ll be
using Ahrefs but many other keyword research tools have the same features with a different
name. They also often offer a free or low-cost trial, including:

● Ahrefs: 1 week for $7
● Semrush: 1 week for free
● Moz: 30 days for free
● Ubersuggest: 1 week for free
To get started on this project, make a copy of our template.

Phase 1: Generate keywords
There are many ways to generate keywords, but starting out, we’ll focus on three.

Off-the-dome: Ideate keywords using your brain and creativity
Value props: Generate words based on the problem your product solves
Autocomplete: Find out popular searches using Google’s autocomplete feature
We’ll walk you through each of these methods. Enter your keyword ideas in the Phase 1 tab of
our spreadsheet.

Important note: You may think of or find keyword variations throughout this phase—keywords
that have the same intent but use different phrasing. Include these in your spreadsheet.

Brainstorm
List everything you can think of that your target audience would search on Google. It can be
tangentially related to your product as long as the person Googling may be interested in your
product at some point. Use your intuition.

For example, if your product is a photo editing app, your target audience might search:

● photo editing app
● photo editing software
● cheap photo editing app
● vintage photo editing
● best photo editing app for android
● photo editing app with filters
Value props
Think about the problem(s) your product solves. What would your target audience Google to
solve it? Consider the different angles they’re approaching it from.

Continuing with the above example, keywords for a photo editing app’s value props might
include:

● how to edit photos on phone
● how to make photos look vintage
● how to make professional photo edits
● how to correct photo lighting
● how to edit photos without photoshop
● filters to make photos look professional
● ways to edit photos on phone
Autocomplete
Begin typing some of the keyword phrases you previously generated into Google and see what
its autocomplete feature suggests. (You may not need to type the entire keyword phrase, as
Google will give suggestions with just one or two words entered.) These suggestions are based
on what users search, so you can easily find out other keywords relevant to your product.

Not all of Google’s autocomplete suggestions will be relevant to your company or product. Look
for keywords that are relevant and copy these into the third column of the Phase 1 tab—these
are the keywords you should focus on targeting.

Phase 2: Collect keyword data
The keywords generated in Phase 1 are a good starting point for what users might search, but
without any quantitative data, they’re only guesses at best for what users are actively searching.
(Google’s autocomplete suggestions do, however, give us a clue about which keyword phrases
may be more popular.)

Copy each group of keywords, one at a time, and paste them into Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer
tool (or the equivalent feature in another keyword research tool). Pasted directly from the
spreadsheet, each keyword should be on a separate line. Since this keyword research is for
SEO, be sure to select Google from the list of search engine options.

Then click the button with the magnifying glass.

Ahrefs will return keyword data, but not all of your entered keywords will necessarily match. You
may see a message that says something like:

That’s fine—it may be that some of your ideated phrases are not very popular or searchers
phrase it differently. You can identify these later on as you go through the data.

For now, select the keywords that do have data. Then add them to a new list in Ahrefs.

You’ll continue building on this list in Phase 3, and eventually export this data to the keyword
research spreadsheet’s Phases 2-4 tab.

Again, most other keyword research tools generally have the same functionality, making it easy
to collect keyword data in a list and then export them. You can go through the same steps here
even with a different tool.

Phase 3: Keyword expansion
We’re going to build on the keywords you came up with in Phase 1. On Ahrefs, click on each of
the options under the Keyword ideas heading in the sidebar:

● Matching terms: Shows other keywords that match or closely resemble your top
inputted keywords (the ones with the highest search volume). Since this list is focused
on matching, it tends to be shorter than the list of related terms.
● Related terms: Shows keywords related to your top inputted keywords. Since this list is
more inclusive, not all keywords will be relevant.
● Search suggestions: Shows autocomplete suggestions for your top inputted keywords.
Think of this as a more detailed and expanded version of Google’s autocomplete feature.
You can also click on Ahref’s Parent topics button to see keywords sorted according to a larger
umbrella topic. Browse through all of these keywords and add those that are relevant to your
product/company to your existing list on Ahrefs.

There’s a lot of data to take in—Ahrefs may have more than a hundred pages of matching and
related keywords. You don’t need to go through all of them. The goal is to collect only the
highest-leverage keywords for your brand. You can quickly identify these based on three pieces
of information:

● The keyword itself: Is it relevant to your product? Could a piece of content about a
particular keyword reasonably direct users toward your business?
● Search volume: You should target a variety of keywords, not only low-volume or
high-volume ones. But as a starting point, focus on keywords with a search volume
between 50 and 5,000. This means only looking at the first page or two of keyword data
rather than combing through 50.
● Difficulty: (Ahrefs uses KD, short for keyword difficulty, here.) Focus on keywords with a
difficulty score below 80. A lower difficulty score suggests a keyword will be easier to
rank for, but this is only a guideline at best.
Keyword research can be very intensive, showing you new angles and perspectives for your
content. Some companies like to dive in deeply all at once, and create a long-term editorial
calendar based on their keyword data. Others prefer to revisit keyword data in shorter, regular
sessions, like on a quarterly basis, since new topics may emerge.

We recommend the latter approach so that you can get a better sense of how search queries in
your niche may change over time.

For this project, once you reach about 100-250 keywords, export it as a CSV file. There are
many columns of data, but the keyword, search volume, and difficulty are most important. Copy
these columns into the Phases 2-4 tab of your spreadsheet.

Mining for keywords

Besides your keyword tool’s suggestions, there are other tactics for finding relevant keywords.
Try these strategies to find other keyword opportunities.

● Competitor URLs: Enter your competitors’ URLs into your keyword research tool. This
could be their homepage or any relevant blog posts. Your keyword tool will show what
keywords your competitors’ pages rank for. For Ahrefs, you can do this with the Site
Explorer feature, under the Organic keywords section.
Grab the keywords that are relevant to your business and can funnel users toward your
product.
● Online communities: Look for relevant communities and forums where people discuss
topics related to your product, like Reddit and Quora. Then enter their URLs into your
keyword tool to find out what keywords they rank highly for. You’ll need to set filters to
narrow your data.
○ Example: In Semrush, if you want to find out all the keywords that a subreddit
and its posts rank for, you should input the subreddit URL and choose
“Subfolder.” You’ll then see data only for posts in the specific subreddit (rather
than all posts across Reddit).

○ Look for pages of online communities that rank highly for keywords; these
represent great opportunities for creating more targeted landing pages or blog
posts for that specific keyword.
Here’s an example of the second strategy in practice.

According to Ahrefs, one Reddit post at r/Entrepreneur ranks #4 in search results for the
keyword phrase “starting a business with 50k”.

Googling the phrase confirms this, showing Quora and Reddit pages at the top of organic
search results.

There’s clear interest in this question—consider how many questions have been asked about it
on two platforms—but few landing pages and blog posts dedicated to answering it. In this case,
keyword research has uncovered a great keyword/content opportunity for those in this particular
niche.

Phase 4: Group keywords
The last phase of this project revolves around sorting your keyword data. At this point, you
should have exported your list of relevant keywords, and copied and pasted them into the
Phases 2-4 tab of the keyword research spreadsheet.

Now it’s time to organize them.

During your keyword research, you likely noticed keywords that were variations of each other. In
our example, there were many phrases related to “how to edit photos on iphone.” These
keywords all have the same goal, so it’s not necessary to create individual pages for each
variation. Instead, you should group these related keywords, as a single piece of content can
address them all.

We’ll organize keywords into clusters so it’s clear how many individual topics exist and what
pages should be created for them.

Here’s how we approach this process:

● Type: Use this field to designate whether a keyword is the primary, secondary, or tertiary
keyword for a cluster.
○ Primary: This is generally the phrasing with the highest search volume; its
popularity indicates that more users approach a particular topic in this way. There
should only be one primary keyword per cluster. Example: Users more commonly
search “how to edit photos on iphone” (4,600 searches per month) than “how to
edit photos on iphone to look professional” (400 searches).
○ Secondary: Secondary keywords have the same user intent as primary
keywords but have a lower search volume. They’re usually the less common
ways of phrasing a particular query.
○ Tertiary: These keywords have the same overarching intent as primary and
secondary keywords but are slightly more nuanced. The user may be looking for
something more specific in a topic. Example: The keyword phrase “how to make
photos look vintage in photoshop” is specific to photoshop—it is a tertiary
keyword for the more commonly searched phrase “how to make photos look
vintage.”
○ More research needed: We’ve included this option for keywords that appear as
one-off topics or don’t seem to belong to any keyword cluster. These may be
topics that require their own blog post but more research is needed to validate
this.
● Page: Use this field to group keywords by specifying the topic they belong to. You can
also think of this field as the string of words that will be used for your URL’s slug later on.
When you sort the spreadsheet by page, you can clearly see all of the keywords that
belong in a single cluster.
○ We often use the primary keyword here, but not always. That might be because
the primary keyword has a typo or grammatical error.
Your organized keyword research acts as a basis for your SEO content strategy. Use this
spreadsheet to prioritize which topics to create content for first (based on search volume and
difficulty) and what keywords should be included in each piece of content.

You can also cross-check each keyword cluster’s topic by searching them in Google and seeing
what results appear; this will help you to understand the main goal behind these searches.

For example, in our sample data, we can see that a lot of users want to find out how to make
their photos look professional. This is a fairly general query—it could refer to posing and staging
for photos, not just editing. But we can see that the lower-volume secondary and tertiary
keywords related to this topic refer to editing apps and programs like Photoshop.

To validate this, we also search for this topic in Google, and articles like “How to Edit Photos like
a Pro in 10 Steps” appear. This is a good sign that the goal of these keywords actually revolves
around photo editing.

Project: Editorial SEO research
Keyword data tells you what keywords to create content about, but you need to do
additional editorial research to find out how you should format your content. This
research involves looking at the current top-ranking content for your target keywords.

For this project, we’ll focus on developing content ideas based on your keyword data.
You’ll end up with a list of ideas that will look like this:

To get started, make a copy of our editorial content research worksheet.

Phase 1: Setup
In our earlier keyword research project, you gathered and sorted keyword data about
topics related to your product. We’ll use this data as the basis for our editorial SEO
research. For this project, you’ll be zeroing in on these primary keywords to see what
content currently ranks for each.

Filter your keyword research spreadsheet’s Phase 2-4 tab by the Type column so
that only primary keywords show.
Then copy the Page column (column E) into the Page column (column A) of your
new content research spreadsheet.
○ We use the Page field rather than the Keyword field because your primary
keyword isn’t necessarily always the name of your page.
Also copy the Difficulty and Search Volume columns from your keyword data and
paste them into their respective columns in the new content research
spreadsheet. Your sheet should look like this:
Phase 2: SERP research
For each Page topic, Google it and look at the results that appear. You don’t need to
click on each result; rather, skim through them and click on the top 2-3.

Consider:

● Are there any trends or patterns in the top-ranking content? For example, are
most of the top results blog posts or review pages?
● How are the top pieces of content formatted? Listicles, slideshows, tutorials,
articles, etc.
● How are the meta titles and descriptions worded? What is emphasized?
● If there is a featured snippet in the results, what info is highlighted?
● What other questions are included in the “People also ask” section?
Here’s an example from Googling “app for stress relief”:

The results are Google’s current idea of what users are looking for. In this case, the
majority of results are listicles, with an average of 15 or so apps listed. And although the
original keyword phrase doesn’t include words like “anxiety” or “relax,” Google clearly
associates them with this search phrase. It would be worth looking at a few of these lists
to see which apps are repeated, as it might show that Google associates certain apps
more with stress relief.

Phase 3: Plan the content itself
Record your observations for each keyword in the worksheet. We’ve included the
following fields:

● Type: Specify what kind of content should be created, e.g., blog posts, product
pages, FAQ pages, review sites.
● Description: Record any high-level notes about how a piece of content should
be written or formatted.
● Title: List any title ideas for your content based on what other sites are doing.
How can you frame the topic in a more exciting and appealing way? What else
can you offer?
● #1-3: For easy reference, copy and paste the URLs of top-performing content
here. You can refer back to these pages quickly instead of having to Google the
keyword again later on.
Remember that your goal is to create content that outperforms what’s currently at the
top of SERPs—you’re not just trying to imitate what others are doing. Instead, think of
ways to outdo other websites and deliver on what users are searching for.

For example, consider the keyword phrase "Facebook ad template." Many results are
pictures of ads, some of which are pulled from Facebook’s documentation. To go a step
further, we could create a blog post with more detailed resources: a Sketch and
Photoshop file that users can download and personalize with their own copy.

There’s no guarantee that this content would reach #1 in search results, but it’s worth
testing because it satisfies the searcher’s intent and few other sites offer such content.

Phase 4: Content creation
Once you’ve finished planning your content, the next step is actually creating it.

A few options here:

Write the content yourself. This is free but time-consuming. If you don’t excel in
writing, your content may not be very good. Choose this option if you have a
small or no budget for content.
Hire an employee or freelancer. Expect to pay anywhere between $0.25 to $1
per word for decent content from skilled copywriters. This may be initially
time-consuming because of recruiting, vetting, hiring, and training. But once a
writer is onboarded, this option can be an efficient, long-term investment.
Hire an agency. Depending on the amount of content you want, this may cost
between $3,000 and $10,000 per month. This option can save you the most time,
as some agencies may even do keyword research. However, it’s expensive and
results may vary. Consider hiring an agency if you have the budget for it and no
time to hire a writer.
Check out our Building a Content Marketing Team lesson for more information about
outsourcing content.

If you decide to write your own content, we recommend using Dropbox Paper for your
rough draft. Follow our guidelines for writing content.

After, you’ll need to set up your blog, where your content will be published. We have
specific instructions for WordPress here.

Project: Optimize Blog Content
As our readings have discussed, on-page SEO can help increase your content’s
chances of ranking well in Google’s search results. This project provides a quick
overview of how to optimize blog posts for your site.

There are two phases in this project:

● Setup: The instructions in this phase revolve around installing plugins for future
use, so you only need to run through this phase once.
● Optimization: Run through the processes in this phase every time you publish
content on your blog.
Since it’s the world’s most popular CMS software, we’ve designed this project for
companies using WordPress. However, platforms like Medium and Squarespace
generally offer the same functionalities for content optimization. Even if you don’t use
WordPress, you can still follow the instructions described in our Optimization phase.

Phase 1: Setup
Step 1: Install Yoast SEO
Yoast SEO is the gold standard for WordPress plugins. You can use it to edit your
content’s title tags and meta descriptions, and the best part is that it’s free. (A premium
version is available, but the free version is all you need.)

To download Yoast SEO:

Log in to your WordPress site.
In the left navigation menu, click Plugins.
Then click on the Add New button next to the Plugins title.
Search for Yoast SEO.
The Yoast SEO plugin should appear as a top result. Click the Install Now
button.
Once the installation is complete, click the Activate button.
Once Yoast SEO is installed and activated, you can find it working at the bottom of any
page or blog post on your site.

Step 2: Install EWWW Image Optimizer
The EWWW Image Optimizer plugin takes care of image optimization by compressing
files to make your site run faster.

To download it:

Log in to your WordPress site.
In the left navigation menu, click Plugins.
Then click on the Add New button next to the Plugins title.
Search for EWWW Image Optimizer.
The EWWW Image Optimizer plugin should appear as a top result. Click the
Install Now button.
Once the installation is complete, click the Activate button.
EWWW Image Optimizer automatically optimizes any new images uploaded to your
site’s Media Library. You can find out the optimization details for each image by viewing
your Media library in list mode and checking the Image Optimizer column.

But if you already have a lot of images uploaded to your site, you can use EWWW
Image Optimizer to compress those existing files all at once.

To do this, hover your cursor over Media in the left navigation menu. Then click Bulk
Optimize. You can then scan for unoptimized images and optimize them.

Step 3: Update your URL structure
SEO-friendly URLs are short but descriptive. They generally include your primary
keyword and follow an “evergreen” structure, i.e., they don’t include the time of their
publication.

To set up your blog posts’ URL structure:

Log in to your WordPress site.
Hover your cursor over Settings in the left navigation menu. Then click
Permalinks.
You’ll see a few options for customizing your blog posts’ URL structure. Select
the Post name option—it’s the most SEO-friendly option.
Click Save Changes.
Important note: Selecting a different permalink option at a later time will affect all of your
existing blog posts’ URL. This will negatively impact your SEO, as any existing links
from other sites or your own will break. So avoid changing your permalink settings after
this.

Phase 2: Optimization
Once you’ve taken care of the setup processes, follow these steps to optimize any new
blog posts on your site.

Step 1: Write an SEO-friendly URL
Whenever you write a post, you can modify its URL directly in WordPress’s editor.

This option appears in the right sidebar if you’re using WordPress’s Gutenberg editor.

If you’re using the Classic editor , it’s directly below the page’s title field.

Remember to:

● Include your primary keyword.
● Use hyphens to separate words.
● Use lowercase letters.
● Minimize or avoid using stop words like the, and, or, of, a, etc.
● Make it short.
A few examples of SEO-friendly URLs:

● http://www.seoblog.com/how-to-fix-slow-website/
● http://www.markettap.com/instagram-food-photography/
● http://www.ecommerceceo.com/product-description-writing/
Step 2: Write an interesting title tag and meta
description
Scroll to the bottom of your new blog post in your WordPress admin to find the Yoast
SEO plugin.

Click the Edit snippet button edit your post’s title tag and meta description. Yoast SEO
will let you know if either are beyond the recommended character count.

Remember that you should make your title tag and meta description compelling so that
users would rather click on your page than others listed in Google’s search results. For
some inspiration, Google your primary keyword to see what the current top results use.

Step 3: Add alt text to images
With EWWW Image Optimizer, any new image you upload to your site’s Media Library
will automatically be optimized. But you’ll still need to add descriptive alt text for each
image.

Using WordPress’s Gutenberg editor , the alt text field appears in the right sidebar after
you’ve clicked on an image in your post.

Using the Classic WordPress editor , clicking on an image in your post will open up a
popup with image details. The alt text field is at the top.

The best alt text is concise, descriptive, and grammatically correct. It doesn’t need to be
a complete sentence. For example, write “butterflies flying over a meadow of flowers”
instead of “butterflies flower meadow.”

Step 4: Add internal links to posts
Since internal links benefit both SEO and user experience, it’s important that each of
your blog posts is linked to from another page on your site. So whenever you upload a
new post to your site, make it a point to link to it from at least 2-3 other pages on your
site.

WordPress makes it easy to identify the number of internal links directed to and from a
post. In your WordPress admin dashboard, hover your cursor over Posts in the left
navigation menu. Then click All Posts to navigate to your post library.

There are two icons on the right side of the table listing your blog posts. One represents
the number of outgoing internal links in a given post (left); the other represents the
number of incoming internal links that link to a given post (right).

If you already have existing blog content, it’s worth looking at these columns to find
orphan pages that don’t have any incoming internal links.

Sort your blog post library by the number of incoming internal links. Use Ahrefs’ Link
opportunities feature for link suggestions. Alternatively, do a quick site search of
relevant keywords that appear in other posts. Then add internal links that direct to your
orphan posts.

Project: Conduct a Basic SEO Audit
If your company already has a blog, one of the highest-leverage places to start with an
editorial/SEO content strategy is reoptimizing your existing blog content. Doing so
makes the most of what you already have, as opposed to starting from square one. But
before you can reoptimize this content, you’ll need to do an SEO audit—an evaluation
of your site to see what (if any) content is currently driving organic traffic.

Paid tools like Semrush can give a more comprehensive overview of your content’s
search performance. However, this project focuses on doing a basic SEO audit using
two free tools: Google Analytics and Google Search Console.

This project is for websites that:

● Are connected to Google Analytics. Here are instructions for installing it.
● Have linked their Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts to
share data. (To do this, follow these instructions from Google. Note that after
linking your accounts, it can take as long as 24 hours before your Search
Console data appears in Google Analytics.)
● Have existing blog content that’s at least six months old. (If you’re just getting
started with an editorial/SEO content strategy, check out our keyword research
project.)
Phase 1: Setup
To get started, open and save a copy of our SEO Audit Worksheet.

Then navigate to Google Analytics. Follow the instructions below and answer the
questions in the SEO Audit worksheet.

It can be tempting to immediately address any issues you identify during the audit. But
we advise making a list of these problems in the SEO Audit Worksheet rather than
trying to solve each in real time.

Phase 2: Traffic Overview
Under Acquisition in the sidebar, click All Traffic and then Channels.

Set your date range to the last six months; Google Analytics’ data will adjust
accordingly. You’ll see a data table organized according to Default Channel Grouping.
This gives you a high-level look at the different ways visitors are discovering your
content.

Answer the following questions in your worksheet.

Which channel drove the highest number of users?
What percentage of your total traffic comes from organic search?
While the goal of SEO is to drive more visitors through Organic Search, this high-level
view can be insightful because it shows where your traffic is coming from. You can get
an idea of how your SEO strategy performs compared to other campaigns, e.g.,
influencer marketing (social media) and press releases (referral).

It’s also worth looking at the other traffic sources here to find out whether your content
distribution efforts are working, e.g., whether people are coming to your site through
guest posts (referral), social media, or another source.

Phase 2: Organic Traffic
Phase 2.1: Weekly Performance
Now click Organic Search in the list of Default Channel Groupings.

By default, the graph of traffic data at the top of the page looks at the number of users
that visit by day. Click Week in the upper right corner to change this view. This makes it
easier to detect any big week-to-week traffic changes.

Then answer the following questions in your worksheet.

What general trend does your organic traffic follow? E.g., it slopes upward.
Are there any sudden dips or spikes in your weekly organic traffic?
It’s worth looking at your organic traffic from this perspective to get an idea of whether
your SEO efforts are working. Here’s what some trends might mean:

● An increase in organic traffic may show that your SEO efforts are working,
whether because you’re publishing more content or your content is moving
further up in SERPs.
● A steady decrease in organic traffic may be a sign that competitors have
published better content, so your content is moving lower in SERP rankings.
● A sudden decrease in organic traffic may be a sign of a core update from
Google, or worse, a penalty.
○ In this case, you should do more research, like which day traffic suddenly
declined and how many pages are affected. Also look up news about
whether Google’s algorithms had any major updates at this specific point
in time.
Phase 2.2: Landing Page Performance
Now scroll down to the table listing each of your landing pages. By default, the data
here is organized using keyword as the primary dimension, but Google Analytics’
keyword data isn’t very good. Oftentimes, instead of showing keywords, Google
Analytics shows “(not provided)” or “(not set)” in the effort to protect user privacy.

Since we’ll look at Google Search Console’s keyword data later, click the Landing Page
option.

Google Analytics’ data will update to show every URL on your site that has received
organic traffic. If you notice any missing URLs from this list, it means those pages
haven’t received any organic traffic in the specific time frame you designated.

Looking at the data table, answer the following questions in your worksheet.

What URLs drove the most new users?
Looking at the percentage of users going to each URL, how is organic search
traffic generally distributed across your site? E.g., one URL drives 30% of organic
traffic; most other pages drive less than 5%.
What URLs drove the least new users?
The goal here is to find your best and worst performing content in terms of traffic. Note
that some of your worst performing URLs might simply not drive much traffic right now
because they were published later—and it takes a while for pages to begin ranking in
search results.

Traffic only tells one part of the story, though. It may be that even though one page gets
a lot of visitors, users don’t stick around on it for long. To get more insight, we’ll dive into
user behavior metrics next.

Phase 3: User Behavior
Phase 3.1: Pages/Session
Sort by Pages/Session. This metric represents the average number of pages users
browse after they’ve landed on a specific URL. Then answer in your worksheet:

What URLs have a high number of pages/session?
Which URLs have a low number of pages/session?
Consider the differences between these URLs. For example, what kinds of pages have
more pages/session and how are they structured? A low number of pages/session
could mean your content’s not very engaging, so users aren’t motivated to stick around.

A few potential reoptimization moves for them:

● Review your content to find weak spots—irrelevant or outdated information, poor
writing, etc. Fix them.
● Place strategic CTAs that relate to your product.
● Add internal links to related posts that users would be interested in. If you notice
low pages/session across your blog posts, try adding a “Recommended Posts”
section.
Phase 3.2: Average Time on Page
Besides Pages/Session, we want to look at other user behavior metrics for your content.
To find these, go to Behavior in the sidebar. Click Site Content , and then click All
Pages. You should be looking at data for the same timeframe you specified earlier.

Before diving in, first filter out pages with less than 300 unique pageviews—there isn’t
enough data to go off of here. You can do this by clicking advanced next to the search
bar.

Remember to click the Apply button to use the filter.

Then sort the data table by Average Time on Page.

Answer in your worksheet:

What URLs have the highest average time on page?
What URLs have the lowest average time on page?
Consider the differences between these pages and how they’re formatted. Some pages
have a very low average time on page relative to the amount of content on them, e.g., a
3,000-word blog post that users spend an average of 11 seconds on.

Like a low pages/session, people might spend less time on a page because your
content isn’t engaging or relevant. To reoptimize these pages, try these tactics:

● Rewrite your introduction, title tag, and/or meta description. Make them
accurate—don’t use clickbait or overpromise.
● Embed videos and audio clips to give users an alternate way of processing info
besides simply reading text.
● Add interactive elements like quizzes, calculators, and polls.
Phase 3.3: Exit Percentage
Now sort by % Exit. Look for any pages that have a number above 50%. This shows
how often people leave your site on that page. List these pages in your worksheet,
under:

What URLs have a high exit percentage (above 50%)?
Here are a few potential fixes to test on these pages:

● Place strategic CTAs that relate to your product.
● Add internal links to other content that visitors would benefit from, e.g., related
blog posts.
Phase 3.4: CTR
Next, we’ll look at the data shared from Google Search Console (only available if you’ve
connected your Google Analytics and Google Search Console accounts). To get to this
data, go to Acquisition in the sidebar. Click Search Console , and then click Landing
Pages.

Sort by Impressions in descending order to find the pages that receive the most
impressions in search results. Some URLs might get fewer clicks than others despite
receiving more impressions, leading to a lower clickthrough rate (CTR).

This indicates that even though users are seeing your page in Google SERPs, they’re
not clicking on it.

What counts as a low vs. high CTR? The higher the CTR, the better. But instead of
aiming for a specific CTR, we recommend comparing the current CTRs of different
URLs against one another. The pages with low CTRs by comparison are the ones you
should focus on. Paste them into your worksheet, under:

What URLs have a low CTR?
One reason behind low organic CTRs: Your page’s title tag and meta description aren’t
very enticing or helpful to users, so they’d rather click on another result. Try rewriting
these elements for low-performing URLs.

Phase 4: Keyword Performance
Now under Search Console in the sidebar, click Queries. Here, Google Search
Console data reveals the keywords your content currently ranks for in SERPs. It’s a
good place to do two things:

● Confirm whether your content is ranking for its target keywords
● Find keyword opportunities—phrases that aren’t your primary keyword but that
your content appears in SERPs for. You can then create new content or modify
existing content to target these keywords.
Sort by Impressions in descending order. Ideally, you should see your primary
keywords at the top with the most impressions and highest CTRs. But in reality, you
may find that your content is ranking for other keywords.

Scroll through the table to find relevant keyword opportunities. Then answer in your
worksheet:

Which keywords generate the most impressions?
Which of these high-impression keywords have high CTRs?
Which of these high-impression keywords have low CTRs?
List any other potential keyword opportunities that you can either create new
content about or edit existing content to target.
There are a few options for what you can do with this insight:

● Edit your current content to better target your primary keywords.
● Edit your current content to better target any new relevant keywords that aren’t
your original primary keywords.
● Create new content to target these newly identified keyword opportunities.
Phase 5: Links
Not all of Google Search Console’s data is available in Google Analytics. To find out link
data, navigate to Google Search Console. Click Links in the sidebar.

You’ll find out your site’s top linked pages, from other websites as well as within your
site. For this audit, we want to focus on internal links, so in the Internal links table, click
More at the bottom. Then sort the table by ascending order to find out which pages
have the fewest internal links.

Answer in your worksheet:

What URLs have the fewest internal links?
Your action item here: Add more internal links to important URLs.

However, if you find any old pages that aren’t quite in line with your website, consider
deleting them. For any pages you delete, remember to remove the few internal links that
direct to them or set up a redirect.

Next Steps
While it’s impossible to see how every visitor interacts with your site, an SEO audit
offers some insight.

In your SEO Audit Worksheet, you may see an overlap in some answers—for example,
the same URLs might have poor user behavior metrics all around. Or maybe the same
URLs that have great user behavior metrics also happen to drive the most traffic. You
can use these findings to draw conclusions about what is and isn’t working on your site,
and then make changes accordingly.

That said, you should log any major content changes somewhere, like in a doc or
spreadsheet. Then, after 6-12 months, do another audit. Compare your pages’
performance over time to see how your reoptimization efforts have affected them.

Project: Map Out Your Site Architecture
Early on in our SEO unit, we discussed the importance of site architecture for not only
SEO but also user experience. This project is best for companies that don’t already
have robust websites—it’s better suited for those that have basic sites which could
benefit from expansion.

To get started, open and save a copy of our Site Architecture Worksheet. Then follow
the prompts in the doc.

Phase 1: Competitor Analysis
Our worksheet begins by asking you to identify a few competitors and browse their
sites. You’ll look at the links in their main menus and footers to see how your
competitors have structured their sites.

Phase 2: Product Analysis
Competitor analysis is a good starting point for getting some ideas about how to set up
your own site hierarchy. In the second phase of this project, we’ll consider other
circumstances that affect how your website should be structured.

You’ll answer the following questions in our worksheet:

● How many products/services do you offer?
● If you have one product, what unique features does it offer?
● If you have many products, can they be grouped together in broad categories?
● Do you offer product demos?
● Do you offer multiple pricing plans?
● How many different audiences do you serve? E.g., different industries or types of
people
● Do you provide product support?
● What kinds of other content do you plan on creating? E.g., blog posts, ebooks,
newsletters, white papers, tutorials
Phase 3: Build Your Site Architecture
Based on your answers and competitor observations, the last phase involves creating
an outline of your site’s layout.

For reference, we’ve provided examples of different types of companies in our
worksheet. If you prefer visualizing your site architecture as a flowchart, we recommend
using a design tool like Miro.

Project: Guest Post/HARO Pitch Tracker
Guest posting and HARO are two effective link-building strategies—but because both
involve a lot of outreach to other parties, they can be difficult to manage and track.
Given these challenges, this project is designed to help organize your pitching process
for guest posts and/or HARO emails.

To get started, open and save a copy of our Guest Post/HARO Pitch Tracker. We
recommend bookmarking this template for quick reference, as you should regularly
update it to track your link-building efforts.

Guest Posts
Not all websites accept guest posts from outside contributors. However, those that do
often have a page of writing guidelines describing the guest posting process.

To find them, Google the topic or industry you’re interested in writing about, plus
keywords about guest posting and writing. For example, your search strings might look
like:

● Personal finance “write for us”
● Personal finance “submit guest post”
● Ecommerce “become a contributor”
● Ecommerce “writing guidelines”
● Email marketing “guest posting guidelines”
Use quotation marks to ensure that their enclosed words appear as an exact match; the
phrases used in the examples above are commonly used in the context of guest
posting.

Here’s what you might see in search results:

Some sites may not be relevant; others may have very stringent guidelines and require
more time and effort. Take a close look at each of the results that appear and record
relevant guest posting opportunities in the Guest Posts tab.

Here’s a quick description of the fields in the Guest Posts tab.

● Website Name: The name of the guest posting website.
● URL: The URL of the guest posting website’s homepage.
● DR: We use DR, short for domain rating, from Ahrefs to measure a website’s
authority. However, you can replace this with any other authority metric of your
choosing depending on which SEO tool you use, e.g., AS from Semrush or DA
from Moz.
● Contact Email: Insert the email address or other contact information for
who/where you should submit a guest post pitch.
● Writing Guidelines: If the site has a page detailing its guest posting guidelines,
insert its URL here.
● Date of Last Action: Record your last date of contact with the website in this
field. You should update this date in accordance with the Status field.
● Status: Use this field to track which stage your guest post is in, from pitching to
submission to publication. This is useful when you have multiple guest post
pitches at different points in the editorial process. Choose from one of our
dropdown options: Pitched; Follow-up #1; Follow-up #2: Pitch approved;
Submitted; Changed needed; Published; Rejected; No response.
● Date Published: Record the date that guest posts are published here.
● Published URL: Insert the URL of published guest posts here.
● Notes: Add any miscellaneous notes about a specific publication or your guest
post here. For example, if your post has been rejected, make a note of any
feedback given by the editor.
Update this tracker regularly to determine the appropriate next steps for each pitch
(e.g., when you should send a follow-up email). Some websites may respond that
they’re temporarily closed to guest posts—also worth noting in your tracker so that you
can reach out again at a later time.

HARO Pitches
First set up a Google alert for your name as well as your company’s. Doing this will help
you track successful HARO pitches, as not all reporters reach out to respondents about
using their quote.

Then sign up as a source on Help a Reporter Out (HARO). After you’ve created an
account, you can set preferences for the kinds of journalist queries you’d like to receive.
Choose the topics related to your product and industry.

You’ll soon begin receiving regular HARO emails with journalist queries. These can be
quite long, so skim the index at the top of each email rather than reading through each
individual query.

If any topic sounds relevant to your industry—and you can contribute meaningfully to
it—prepare a response for the reporter. Then send it to the helpareporter.net email
address listed with the query. Be sure to submit it by the query’s deadline.

Once you’ve sent out a pitch, enter its information into the HARO Pitches tab of our
tracking template. Here’s a quick description of the fields in the tab.

● Outlet: The name of the site or publication listed in the query. If it’s anonymous,
insert “Anonymous.”
● Subject: Record the subject line of your pitch email here. This makes it easier to
relocate the email in your inbox in case you want to reuse any of your pitch copy.
● Reporter: Record the name of the reporter who submitted the HARO query here.
Over time, you may notice the same journalists asking for quotes about your
niche—try building a rapport by writing more personalized emails.
● Date Sent: The date you send your HARO response.
● Date Published: If your HARO response is successfully published, record the
date that it goes live here.
● Published URL: Insert the published URL here.
Whenever one of your pitches is successful, log it in your tracker. Over time, review this
tab to get an idea of your HARO pitches’ success rate.

If you find that your HARO emails aren’t generating good results, it may be worth
revisiting your pitching strategy. That could be writing more concise emails, mentioning
your credentials at the end of your email pitch instead of the beginning, or something
else—experiment to make your email pitches more compelling.

This module explains how to acquire customers through LinkedIn organically, without
using ads.

This material comes from conversations with LinkedIn employees and top audience
builders who know how the underlying algorithm works.

Specifically, we'll learn to acquire customers by posting to your personal LinkedIn
account —not a brand account. That's because people follow people, not brands.

We'll build an organic audience that we'll later convert into customers. Much like we'd do
on Twitter or YouTube.

Why would we want to use LinkedIn for this?

Because LinkedIn generates nearly 300% more B2B leads than Facebook:

● The platform has 660m active users.
● 63mm of them are in decision-making roles.
If you're a B2B startup, you should have a presence on LinkedIn. It has much of the
same virality potential as Facebook or YouTube, but with remarkably better B2B
performance.

A snapshot of the LinkedIn organic funnel

Why LinkedIn organic instead of LinkedIn ads?
LinkedIn ads generally perform terribly.

They work best for education, recruiting, and other career-related advertisers who
generate $15k+ in revenue per customer.

Other verticals often see unsustainable customer acquisition costs: LinkedIn ad clicks
are expensive and the subsequent on-site conversion is poor.

LinkedIn organic , however, has a surprisingly high ROI. Many marketers don’t realize
that LinkedIn posts attract enough engagement to single-handedly drive top of funnel
strategies.

Today, LinkedIn remains a content deficient platform: there is more content demand
than supply. Of all the major social channels, it remains easiest to become a top
influencer on LinkedIn.

The time that businesses spend investing in Twitter should likely be invested in LinkedIn
instead.

A bold statement, but the facts bear it out.

What makes LinkedIn so special?
The main advantage of LinkedIn is its "firmographic" data: business and employee
information you can target by. No other social network has this level of specificity and
consumption context.

Further, LinkedIn is the primary platform people use to advance their careers. B2B
companies that help with career development and recruiting see outsized success
because they're getting in front of people who actually want to see their products.

Case Study
Taylor Offer took advantage of LinkedIn's reach to build a following of over 50k people in
9 months. Now, he has over 100k followers.

What this module covers
The LinkedIn strategy looks like this:

Contribute meaningfully to LinkedIn's content pool.
Acquire LinkedIn followers from posting that good content.
Build trust with those followers.
Get their email addresses.
Email them to get off-platform conversion.
Regardless of whether you're running a LinkedIn organic or paid strategy, your
on-platform KPI is usually the same: capture email addresses.

Why? In B2B marketing, it's hard to get an immediate purchase for high-consideration
products. Especially those requiring the approval of multiple stakeholders.

So, the strategy is to warm up leads, get their trust, incept them with the need for your
product, then take things to a deeper conversation.

The backbone of this approach is getting your audience to engage your LinkedIn
posts. This distributes your content outside of your existing audience. Then,
when new LinkedIn users see your content, some will follow you—and your
audience growth flywheel begins.

Accordingly, here's how this playbook is structured:

Create a steady flow of leads
Writing posts that drive views, engagement, and conversion
Conversion systems to take leads off-platform
How to design a profile that increases your follow conversion rate
1. Create a steady flow of leads
Let's cover how to connect with LinkedIn users. These folks will ideally share your
LinkedIn posts so they reach new audiences who in turn follow you.

Insight: Connect in clusters for greater virality
Although the key modality for securing audience engagement is being followed,
connecting remains valuable because it's an action that you take.

Whitelist the accounts that are most valuable to your business, and systematically
connect to them. You'll be pairing this strategy with the inbound follower strategy.

LinkedIn limits you to 30,000 connections, so be methodical about who you connect
with. If you turn on a connections bot and let it rip, you'll reach that limit within the year.

When deciding who to connect with, break down your audience into sub-audiences,
which are clusters of people sharing the same job function within the same city. Then
connect with one sub-audience at a time.

For example, if you're selling your product to web developers, first connect to everyone
who’s a Director of Engineering in San Francisco. Then move on to every Mobile
Developer in San Francisco. When you're done with SF, move onto the next city.

Why?

When the LinkedIn algorithm detects post engagement concentrated from a
cluster of similar people, it's likely to promote your post to more people just like
them. (We've confirmed this strategy with LinkedIn team members.)

If, instead, you have engagement all over the map and job spectrum, LinkedIn won't
know who the ideal persona is to promote your content to.

Insight: Avoid connection messages for greater acceptance rates

You'll find guides all over the Internet suggesting you include a bespoke message when
sending connection requests on LinkedIn.

Consider avoiding that.

Our data found that when everyone is loading connection requests with
templated messages, requests without messages seem more real—and get
accepted more.

Neal O'Grady (via LinkedIn)

Automating connections—will you be banned?
To handle these connection requests, many marketers use bots.

As a rule of thumb, it's best to only engage in natural behavior on LinkedIn. That
minimizes the risk of being penalized by the algorithm.

But our investigative research confirms that—at the time of this
posting—LinkedIn's team isn't planning to ban accounts who use connection
automation. Nor does it penalize an account's content visibility for the use of
connection bots. (This could change in the future.)

Why don't they punish this behavior? Ultimately, the broader each account's reach, the
more engagement content gets—and that helps LinkedIn.

Just don’t be egregious by over-using automation and behaving spammily. Connect
with people most likely to want to connect with you.

Third-party tool: Dux-Soup

Dux-Soup is a popular Chrome plugin that automates LinkedIn connecting. Alternatives
we've heard good things about include Phantom Buster and We-connect.

Here's how to use Dux-Soup:

Don’t exceed Dux-Soup’s default number of auto-connections per day. In fact, go
20% under (80 contacts a day instead of 100) to play it safe. This prevents
LinkedIn from flagging aggressive automated activity and possibly sending you
an account warning.
Enter a search query for your target sub-audience into LinkedIn’s default search
bar. Narrow your search using the prioritization framework we discussed earlier
(by job title, location, etc).
Click on Dux-Soup’s "Visit & Connect" button while viewing that page. It’ll crawl
through the search results list and send connection requests one at a time—up to
your daily limit.
Dux-Soup integrates with your LinkedIn profile.

Again, for optimal performance, start by not including a Connection message. A/B test
one later if you'd like.

Our take: you can leverage automation to double down on a channel where you already
have an arbitrage opportunity— content deficient platform (more reach) x
automation = high ROI.

Get an initial burst of connections
To complement your sub-audience outreach, we recommend bootstrapping your initial
connections by importing all the people you already know.

The goal with jumpstarting connections is to unlock access to other LinkedIn members
who are not yet in your network.

LinkedIn blocks you from connecting with people who are multiple degrees
removed from your personal network. The more connections you have to start,
the larger your breadth of potential connections for automatic outreach.

● Export your company mailing list and your contacts out of Gmail. Put them in a
spreadsheet.
● Bulk import them into LinkedIn.
● Click on the "My network" tab.
● Click "Connections" on the left rail.
● Click "More options" on the right rail.
● You'll have option to upload your spreadsheet file.
● Say “yes” to inviting non-matches.
All those people will now get sent an email by LinkedIn suggesting they add you.

LinkedIn also allows you to sync your email so that they periodically send notifications
to new contacts from your email account.

2. Post content that people engage with
As you're acquiring followers and connections, you should regularly post quality content.

LinkedIn posts get a lot of exposure
LinkedIn is a high-commitment channel that requires persistence. The most influential
LinkedIn creators each dedicate 30+ minutes per day to it. This isn’t a second-tier
consideration; your team needs to treat this like running a second blog.

Since LinkedIn is a content deficient platform —more demand than supply—you get
more reach than you do on other platforms.

As a result, LinkedIn posts:

● Stay on feeds longer : The post visibility algorithm has a slow decay, meaning
your content will linger in feeds for days. Top audience builders on LinkedIn
report that posts build steam 48-96 hours after they're posted. And they can
sustain continuous engagement for up to a month.
● Reach people far outside your immediate network —even if they don't go viral.
When a person in your network comments on your post, it shows the post in their
own audience's news feed.
As a result, LinkedIn posts routinely get more views than they would on other
platforms—assuming the same follower/connection count.

For example, Neal's LinkedIn post below was viewed by almost 550,000 people. He
only had 7,000 followers at the time. That's a massive advantage over other social
media platforms that limit impressions to a portion of users who follow you.

Neal O'Grady (via LinkedIn)

We'll walk through engineer posts to get reach like this.

The optimal posting strategy
LinkedIn's news feed algorithm promotes people who:

● Frequently post high-engagement content.
● Spark conversations in the comments section and reply to people asking
questions.
Specifically, you want to build an audience that admires your insights and perspective,
and also feels compelled to chime in.

Your goal, therefore, is to have a steady stream of relevant insights injected into
your posts.

Ideas become insights when they hit the following criteria:

● Novel—is this idea new or is it at least a fresh take on an existing idea?
● Actionable—can my audience immediately act on the idea?
● High-leverage—when my audience acts on the idea, can it meaningfully change
their work or their lives?
Insights are rarely brand new , but they're recycled and repurposed from others. We
suggest sourcing insights by:

● Consuming content from thought leaders in your area of expertise: sign up for
newsletters, curate your social media feeds, and listen to valuable podcasts.
● Connect with the brightest minds in your field and consistently work through
cutting-edge techniques and solutions to the largest problems impacting the
field—for example, we chat with other top growth agency founders to trade
learnings at least once a month.
How to structure viral posts
This is the most important section of this playbook.

We'll show you the types of posts that get you the most reach on LinkedIn. And then
give you examples so you can replicate these for yourself.

We identified these themes by interviewing top LinkedIn influencers, reverse
engineering viral posts, and experimenting on our own LinkedIn accounts.

Viral posts fall into two themes

There are two post themes that get traction on LinkedIn: industry-focused and
human-focused.

Industry-focused posts are insight-driven pieces of content that cement your position
as a thought leader in your industry. This theme should be your priority.

Credit: Dave Gerhardt (via LinkedIn)

Compare that to human-focused posts , which are posts that do not relate to your
industry. The goal of human-focused posts is to connect with your audience on an
emotional level. This is achieved through storytelling and vulnerability.

We see top influencers use human-focused posts for about one-third of their total post
volume.

Credit: Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)

The combination of these two post themes is what builds a high-affinity audience: your
posts provide industry insight and a relatable human touch.

Post structure

There are three post structures that pair with the two post themes:

● Pure text
● Resources
● Stories
We'll break down each then we'll dive into examples.

Pure text

Pure text posts include only text.

We've found that it's best to stick to one or two-sentence paragraphs in your posts.
Avoid long paragraphs at all costs.

That's because about 60% of LinkedIn traffic comes through mobile, and short, punchy
copy reads much better on mobile due to the small screen size. It also breaks up the
copy and makes it more inviting to read.

Here's how to make text posts work:

● Lead with a hook : LinkedIn truncates posts so that only your first two sentences
show on the feed. After that, people need to click to read more. So it's critical to
include a hook in your first two sentences that motivates readers to click.
● Add context
● End with a zinger
Hooks generally follow the format of asking a tantalizing question or implying something
controversial that isn’t fully revealed until they click "see more." Here are a few
examples of hooks that work well:

● An unbelievable statistic or quote
● A startling failure you experienced
● Stating that the status quo is wrong
● A self-evident description of a useful resource, e.g. "My favorite tools for creating
landing pages are..."
Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)

Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)

Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)

After the hook comes the context. This sounds obvious, but many LinkedIn posts fail to
catch on because they lack the context that properly sets up the zinger.

Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)

Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)

Then finish the post with a zinger—an insight bomb.

The best zingers are elegant statements that leave the reader with something to think
about. This is what gets people to hit the like and share buttons.

Dave Gerhardt (via LinkedIn)

Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)

Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)

Resource posts

Resource posts follow the exact same structure as pure text, with one small difference.
Instead of ending with a zinger, you attach a media asset to your post.

It looks like this:

● Hook
● Context
● Asset
Two examples include thematic image galleries (multiple images that show examples of
a topic) and infographics/spreadsheets with useful data.

Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)

Dave Gerhardt (via LinkedIn)

Brian Balfour (via LinkedIn)

The image asset is the insight—it's what provides a dopamine hit for your audience.

Top LinkedIn users recommend using a thematic gallery when you're trying to show
your audience useful examples—things that they can replicate. Think infographics and
spreadsheets.

Story posts—a human-focused approach

Adding stories to you content mix is critical for virality.

Why?

They're human. It makes people build affinity toward you—to see you as more than a
corporate stooge.

Story posts also do something special: they build trust. When you tell vulnerable stories,
you let people empathize with you. And believe in your authenticity.

So how do you write a good story post? Try:

● A lesson you learned the hard way
● A funny encounter you had
● Poke fun at an ironic way people do things
● Stories about challenging yourself
Katie Mitchell (via LinkedIn)

Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)

Final touches on your posts
Insight: Connect with people who like your post

When you make it a priority to continuously post quality content, you'll have LinkedIn
users outside of your immediate network like and comment on your posts.

Tip: send connection requests to all of these people. They're likely to accept your
request since it's top of mind for them. They'll also feel valued since you took the time to
notice their engagement and follow up by connecting.

Ask for comments

Always prompt readers to leave comments. Comments are the number one signal
LinkedIn measures to boost your post’s public exposure beyond your existing audience.
LinkedIn prioritizes content where conversations are happening.

And, as a reminder, when a commenter comments, their followers will often see
their comment. Through our research, we've found that getting comments can 4x
your post's view count.

Here are a few ways to ask followers for comments:

● “Leave a comment below if you recommend another resource.”
● “How often does this happen to you? Respond here and let me know.”
● “Do you have any stories like this of your own?”
● “What hacks do you use for accomplishing X?”
When people comment, respond to further encourage conversation. Also tag popular
people in your network to chime in, answer in-depth, and ask even more questions. The
more conversations you have in the comments, the more reach you can see.

Credit: LinkedIn

Insight: Should you include links in your post?

We used to recommend that people avoid including links in your posts.

Why?

LinkedIn’s algorithm used to penalize you for sending people off of LinkedIn.

But it has been reported (and widely discussed) that, in May 2020, LinkedIn made
a change to the algorithm, and linking away from LinkedIn is no longer penalized.

But it's important to remember that the algorithm favors content that gets lots of likes,
comments, and shares. If you link off-platform, you run the risk of people clicking your
link and not engaging with your content on LinkedIn. Their engagement modality shifts.

While it's helpful to drive people to your own site, if your post fails to get likes,
comments, and shares, it will reach fewer people.

So link as you wish—so long as your posts are still designed to get strong engagement
on the platform.

Andrew Chen (via LinkedIn)

Insight: When to post
The algorithm works against you if you don't post often.

If you go 28 days without posting, you'll get so heavily demoted in the feed that
your next post will only be seen by a small percentage of your connections.

Further, posting at the right versus wrong time of day easily triples your reach.

You want to post at times where most of your LinkedIn followers are active. This
typically means around 8:30am in the time zone of the majority of your audience. We've
tested this heavily.

Complementary strategy: Commenting
The LinkedIn experts we interviewed recommend commenting on other influencers'
posts. If their posts get millions of views and you have the top comment, you get many
of those views too—which equates to more exposure and followers for you.

Try to comment on 2-3 posts per day. That way people see your insightful comments all
over the place—plus those LinkedIn influencers will be more likely to comment back on
your posts, which shows your content in their audiences' feeds and drives up your
views.

Taylor Offer (via LinkedIn)

Commenting is also a way to test what to post: if one of your comments receives a lot of
engagement, turn it into a full-fledged post of your own. Repurpose your work.

3. Getting email addresses
Ok, let's take a step back.

So far, we've covered:

● Connecting with sub-audiences
● Posting content to get engagement and new followers
Our goal on LinkedIn is getting a soft conversion—typically an email address. We add
that email address to a drip campaign to eventually generate revenue.

But it's not easy to take people off LinkedIn. This is where most LinkedIn funnels break.

And that's by design—LinkedIn wants people to stay on-platform.

When we spoke to LinkedIn audience builders, one shared that only 5% of his 100k+
followers are signed up for his newsletter.

Methods of collecting emails
We've identified two ways to capture emails from your LinkedIn audience.

Send direct messages (DMs) to your audience members with a valuable free
resource that requires their email address to see it.
Build a system around capturing email addresses through your content.
Gate your best insights so that readers need to provide an email address to see
them.
Occasionally link to landing pages to capture emails in exchange for resources
like newsletters or one-pagers.
1. DM strategy
If you already have valuable, free resources to entice connections with, sending direct
messages offering that resource is an effective strategy. Require them to provide their
email address in order to get the resource.

They'll trust you if you've been posting insightful and human posts for a while.
That's how this LinkedIn strategy ties together.

In fact, the best way to get DM responses is to have first commented on your recipients'
posts. This surfaces you on their radar and builds the expectation of reciprocity.

Here are some examples of valuable free products to offer:

● Truly useful email newsletters—insightful, actionable newsletters that get people
excited.
● Databases such as lists of recruiters, VC funds, and job opportunities.
● In-depth guides—long form educational content.
If you don’t have an existing asset such as these, head to the "Capturing emails through
your content" section.

How to DM your connections

The DM conversation isn't where the end conversion happens. Users don't trust you
enough to make a purchase just yet.

So instead of following the scripted sales approach, provide genuine value.

The goal is twofold:

Get email addresses you can send drip emails to.
Get them to trust your brand by seeing how valuable your resources are.
This DM has worked well for us. It's human, it leads with value, and it's risk-free.

Two examples of DM templates you can use:

● “Btw I put together a spreadsheet of the best VCs with their contact information.
Since we went through YC we thought this would be helpful to founders looking
for funding. We keep it gated and only share it with top founders. If you want to
take a look just shoot me your work email and I'll get it to you."
● "Heads up that my team and I wrote a thorough playbook on landing page
optimization. Happy to share with you if you think it'd be helpful. We keep it gated
and only share it with top founders and marketers. If you want to take a look just
shoot me your work email and I'll get it to you."
Connections that receive this message get a relevant free resource and there are no
strings attached. Why wouldn't they join?

And just like that, we've got an email address.

Is this a lot of work? Yes. But, on LinkedIn, you know you’re targeting all the
firmographically-appropriate leads. You’re not spraying and praying. Everyone is worth
something to you.

Insight: Don't DM right away

Try waiting at least a month after connecting with folks so your audience has had time to
digest your insightful posts before you reach out.

2. Capturing emails within LinkedIn content
Here's the best approach we've identified for capturing emails directly from your posts:

● Regularly post insightful content without asking for anything—including emails.
● One out of every 5 posts, provide half of your content then require that they click
a link and enter their email to get the other half.
In other words, first build trust that your content is good. Then tease them with
something that requires a small transaction.

Build up from there.

LinkedIn also offers onsite newsletters where you can embed CTAs to capture emails:

Andrew Yu (via LinkedIn)

Getting the purchase
Now that you have a steady flow of new leads’ email addresses, we’re officially moving
beyond LinkedIn—the platform has done its job.

This is the start of the final stage of your funnel—purchase conversion—where you’ll
leverage email drips to sell to your leads.

Drip campaigns are important enough to cover in an entire playbook, but here’s how we
view final conversion in the context of your LinkedIn funnel:

Since you’ve done the hard work of building affinity through your LinkedIn content, your
leads should be excited to consume everything you create. A portion of your leads will
be willing to pay for your products or services now that they know who you are, trust
you, and view you as a thought leader.

Well-done drip campaigns get those leads across the finish line.

4. Optimizing your profile for follows
The best LinkedIn influencers are methodical about their profiles—it's not something to
gloss over.

It's the equivalent of the landing page on your website. You wouldn't ignore optimizing
your page, would you?

Change your CTA
Here's the most critical change you can make on your profile:

Change your "Connect" button to a "Follow" button.

Dave Gerhardt (via LinkedIn). Note that the typical "Connect" button is replaced with a
"Follow" button.

Here's why:

In our research, we learned that connections is an outdated feature. LinkedIn is
prioritizing the follower model of engagement in their future roadmap. Their engineering
team is actively building features for "audience builders"—the LinkedIn equivalent of
influencers.

There's still value in connecting with people as a source of lead generation—we already
covered this—but connections require a lot of steps:

● Someone views your profile.
● They hit connect and add a note.
● You're required to go in, see the request, and accept it. Until all that happens, the
user doesn't start seeing your posts.
In comparison, when a user hits the "Follow" button, your content is immediately
introduced to their news feed.

Additionally, we know that LinkedIn limits you to 30,000 connections, but you can have
an unlimited amount of followers.

Here's how to change your profile action button:

Go to your privacy settings (see the dropdown under "Me" then "Settings & Privacy"),
click "Visibility" on the left panel, then "Visibility of your LinkedIn activity." Then click
"Followers." You'll see the "Make follow primary" button. Switch it on.

Profile basics
The framework for optimizing the rest of your LinkedIn profile is simple: appear
maximally useful to the persona you want to buy from you. That means:

Write a bio header that highlights your social proof in your space. This is critical.
This header is displayed on your outgoing connection requests to LinkedIn
members. It's the description others use to judge whether they should accept.
Include a concise "about" description that explains why you're worth following.
Example: Julian Shapiro

Julian founded Demand Curve, so his target audience includes entrepreneurs and
marketers who are looking to advance their growth strategies.

Julian Shapiro (via LinkedIn)

In Julian's bio header, he features:

● YC S19 as social proof (he went through Y Combinator).

LinkedIn's new feature: stories
LinkedIn added a new feature on September 24th, 2020 called Stories. They're photos
and videos that vanish 24 hours after posting. Sound familiar? It's a rip on Snap and
Facebook (including Instagram).

Credit: LinkedIn
But here's why LinkedIn stories are worth testing:

LinkedIn already struggles to get users to post to the feed. There's a chance that
not enough users post to stories, either. This is another opportunity to take
advantage of the fact that there is more demand for content than there is
supply—more reach.
Since stories just launched, LinkedIn will promote them heavily—its goal is to get
users to engage with new features. If you consistently use stories early, you give
yourself the opportunity to ride the wave of rising popularity. Some users will get
a disproportionate share of story views.
Stories give audiences a glimpse into the BTS of the professional world. Content
creators can show audiences their day-to-day. It's relatable and can quickly build
affinity.
Introduction: Cold Outreach
Here’s what we’ll cover in this module:
● Determining which people are worth targeting
● Finding their contact details
● Writing great cold emails
● Relevant case studies to help you test cold email for your startup
● Building a process for sending emails
● Optimizing performance
● Other tactics (like pre-targeting, Twitter, and LinkedIn)
Overview
“Cold outreach” refers to reaching out to someone who doesn’t know you in order to
build a relationship and eventually transact with them (a sale, favor, or an opportunity).

Examples:

● B2B SaaS startups reach out to Enterprise businesses to sell their products.
● Agencies reach out to business owners to sell their services.
● B2C companies reach out to high-profile influencers for affiliate partnerships.
● Freelancers reach out to business owners to get contract work.
Cold outreach is the lifeblood for some early stage startups. When you’re strapped for
cash, you can put your time into cold outreach and secure sales that give you the cash
flow to get off the ground.

In this module, we’ll focus on cold outreach for the purpose of lead generation—creating
a flow of leads. “Leads” are simply prospects that we’ll turn into paying customers
through further email, calls, or demos.

There are a number of ways you can use cold outreach to connect with prospects,
including:

● Email: Agencies can send targeted emails that help business owners solve
pressing problems.
● LinkedIn: B2B SaaS companies can close demos by sending direct messages to
people with specific job titles.
● Twitter: Founders can use tools to find VCs in their networks and pitch their
portfolio companies.
● Physical mail: An insurance broker sends a letter to every new homeowner as
they move to the neighborhood.
● Cold calling: Isn’t a fit for most modern startups anymore. Not many decision
makers 1) answer calls from random numbers nor 2) have the patience to sit
through a sales call. Calls work—but they’re used to close leads that you warmed
up through other forms of cold outreach.
Cold email generally outperforms all other cold outreach channels. So we’ll focus
primarily on that. But we’ll also cover novel cold outreach methods that are working for
fast-growing startups, including Twitter and LinkedIn outreach.

Move on from cold calling
Cold email is a modern day take on cold calling.

Companies used to grow leads by “smiling and dialing.” Now, technology has improved
to the point where companies can nurture leads through email before moving leads
down funnel with:

● More emails
● Scheduled calls
● Webinars
● Product demos
Cold email doesn't need to bear the burden of closing the deal. It’s sole purpose is to
move people along the funnel.

Why you need to learn cold email
No one likes getting cold emails.

But when it’s done correctly, it works. Some businesses single-handedly grow through
cold email.

Here’s an example:

This is cold email perfection:

● Clearly indicate why you’re reaching out and how you’ll add value—and be
specific: “Customer IO will increase revenue by ~12%.”
● Proactively handle key objections.
● Add a personal touch up front, which acts as the hook for the rest of the note.
● End with one clear CTA. And since it’s the first email, ask for interest instead of
time in your CTA. “Do you think we’re a fit?” works better than “Let’s book a call”
at first.
● Includes “persona-matching”—the presumed sender of the email isn’t a
salesperson. It’s the employee who most closely matches the role of the intended
recipient. This builds trust and can lead to better cold email ROI.
We’ll teach you how to send effective cold email campaigns like these.

What makes email so great?

Targeting : Emails let you target exactly the people you want, and when done right,
they’re so personalized that people can’t help but respond. You can’t get that with ads.
Why? Ads cast a wider net, meaning you’ll always end up hitting people who will never
buy from you. A 2% CTR would be impressive with ads. For email? You can see CTRs
as high as 50% on strong campaigns.

Access : Most decision makers still manage their own email inboxes. This is a massive
opportunity. So long as you have the correct email address, your message lands in front
of decision makers as they’re actively making business decisions.

Low capital investment : All you need is an email account, and potentially software to
help you automate your process. So it makes sense to start with this channel if it has
potential for you. That way you’re not burning cash before you’re generating revenue
from clients.

Who should use cold outreach
Most early stage startups should test cold outreach, but it’s most profitable for B2B
companies.

Why?

Cold outreach isn’t “free”—that’s a common misconception. Due to the labor involved in
outreach and sales, CACs can be relatively high. In many cases, only high margin
products can support cold outreach as a growth channel.

B2B companies typically have a higher margin than consumer companies.

Think of it like this:

Say you run an online shoe company where you sell $100 pairs of shoes that cost you
$25 to make. Cold outreach might not be worth your time: You’ll likely spend hours
sending emails, setting up calls, and managing the funnel. Labor hours would exceed
your $75 margin.

But for a B2B SaaS business selling $1,000/month contracts? 5 labor hours to close a
deal might result in thousands of dollars of profit.

That doesn’t mean you should rule out cold outreach if you’re not at a B2B company
with high margins.

You can still make cold outreach work. Here’s a framework for identifying companies
that cold outreach could work for:

● High margin products that can afford the labor of emailing and closing.
● Products that are expensive and people aren’t actively searching for them (if
people are searching for your product, search ads and content might be more
effective).
● Most early stage startups that need a low capital investment way to sell and
generate revenue so that they can afford to test other channels—like running ads
or hiring a content writer.
Specific examples of companies that should test cold outreach:

● Agencies who charge $2000+/month per client and collect their first payment
after the first month.
● Most B2B SaaS companies.
● Companies selling expensive physical goods (like equipment or medical
devices).
● Edtech companies that sell high-margin digital products.
If you’re deciding whether or not you should test cold outreach, here’s an actionable
framework. Test cold outreach if you meet one or both of the following criteria:

If your profit margins are greater than $500 per closed deal AND your payback
period is less than 2 months, you should consider trying cold outreach.
You’re at an early stage startup that sells products over $100 and you can afford
to sell at low margins to get off the ground—do things that don’t scale until you
can afford to test channels that scale.
Creating a cold email strategy
Here’s what a cold outreach pipeline could look like:

● Generate a prospect list.
● Invite the qualified prospects (via email) to an online product demo, sales call, or
webinar.
● Address their objections and entice them to purchase.
● Negotiate and close their contract.
We’ll show you how to test cold outreach as a growth channel. That means
standardizing your approach and running tests to see if you can acquire customers
profitably through cold outreach.

Client story
Demand Curve worked with a company that sold a Wordpress plugin—one that lets you
easily add an email newsletter subscription to your site.

All the competing plugins had issues: They were hard to integrate, poorly designed, and
in general just a pain to work with.

How did cold outreach help them? We programmatically scraped blogs to find people
who were using a competing plugin. Then, we used a virtual assistant to pull the name
of the company behind the site and looked up the owner’s email address on Clearbit.
We sent them a cold email referencing the exact competing plugin that they were
using and why it was worse than ours.

Here’s a screenshot of that email:

That email led to over $500,000 in sales within a couple months. Over 40% of people
responded to our emails. (Response rates are usually 2-10%).

This story is an extreme example—most targeting strategies won’t require coding like
this—but it shows the power of personalized emails sent to a highly targeted
audience. Spraying and praying won’t get you anywhere.

It’s important to note that this same strategy could work even if we didn’t get email
addresses.

You could, for instance, find your targets’ associated LinkedIn and Twitter profiles. Then
reach out on either platform. Cold outreach on social platforms works particularly well if
you have a sizable following that acts as social proof: Large followings indicate that you
provide lots of value. If you don’t have a following, email generally works better.

How to Find the Right People
Finding the right people to target
If you email the wrong people, they won’t respond.

So finding the right people is not just critical—it’s 90% of the art of cold emailing.

Follow the steps below with a goal of creating a target persona for your email efforts.
The target persona is simply the type of person that you get emails for. Over time, you
can test different target personas against each other and see which perform best. For
example, say you sell HR services. You might start off by emailing CEOs of construction
companies. If that doesn’t work well, you might try another target persona of founders at
brand-new startups.

Here’s how you can identify a target persona that will most likely buy from you.

Speak to existing customers
Start by understanding your current customers and the problems they face.

Interview your current customers. Ask:

● What value prop resonates with them most?
● What’s the biggest improvement they’ve implemented thanks to your solution?
● What got them to purchase from you?
● What other options did they turn down to do business with you?
● How did they hear about you?
● What are their job titles?
Let’s walk through an example. Say you sell email marketing software to small brick and
mortar business owners. Let’s walk through the questions we proposed above:

● What value prop resonates with them most?
○ They’re not technical, so they like how easy your product’s UX is.
● What got them to purchase from you?
○ Simplicity of use, and your inexpensive small business pricing tier.
● What other options did they turn down to do business with you?
○ They didn’t like MailChimp’s lack of features, and Drip was too expensive.
● How did they hear about you?
○ Their friend and local small business owner raved about your product over
coffee.
Use their responses to:

Deeply understand their desires.
Create a strategy to locate more people like them and craft messaging to them
accordingly. We’ll cover this below.
Now it’s one thing to go back and interview customers retrospectively. Great.

But you can also build a system to continuously interview your customers right after
they choose to buy your product. That’s when they’re going to be most helpful to you,
since they just hired you to be the solution to a pain point that they were experiencing.

Use the Jobs To Be Done framework for ongoing interviews: Interview people at the
time that they switched to you so you can:

Understand the exact reason they switched to your solution.
Figure out the "job" they are hiring your company's product to do.
The Jobs To Be Done perspective is product agnostic—it simply focuses on the problem
that the customer is solving, which allows you to reverse engineer great cold emails
(we’ll cover this shortly).

Find customers higher up the ladder of product
awareness
Once you understand your ideal customer, the next step is to find the names and job
titles of people who are as far along the customer journey as possible.

As a refresher, here’s a picture of the ladder of product awareness, which is a proxy for
a customer journey:

Higher up on the ladder, prospects will fit into one of these categories:

● They’re choosing between competitors.
● They’re using a competitor.
● They’re using a competitor and are dissatisfied with them.
People that fit into the last category are prime targets because:

You already know they’re motivated to solve the problem that your business
solves—they’ve already paid for a solution to that problem.
You know they’re looking for a reason to move away from their current solution.
Most of the startups we work with don’t put much thought into how their competitors
acquire customers. Even more problematic, they rarely track what happens to their
customers after they purchase. What problems do customers face?

Let’s look at an example using Salesforce.

If you use Salesforce, you’ll end up on Trailhead, their tutorial site, at some point. And if
you ever have problems with their product, you’ll start posting in their forums. Or maybe
you’ll seek solutions in a shared slack group.

As a competitor, you can monitor activity of unhappy users. Often you’ll be able to find
their contact information through the forums or in Slack groups (which we’ll show you
how to do below).

Here are some more places where you can find targets that are already working with
your competitors:

● Competitor community slack channels and Facebook groups.
● Identify customer logos from their landing pages.
● Poach names from sales webinars the competitor runs.
● Look at commenters on their YouTube channels.
● Find users in their support forum posts, e.g., Zendesk.
● Track down everyone who tweet-mentions them.
● Grab case study customers and testimonials from their website.
● Track down the people who leave Chrome Store reviews.
● Find third-party review sites like GetApp, TrustRadius, Capterra and find the
names of reviewers. Then use Clearbit to get their contact information.
● Use BuiltWith to profile prospects by the technologies present on their
websites—you can set up alerts when tech is added/removed so that you know
when to reach out.
Finding urgent customers
Sometimes you can’t find enough of your competitors’ dissatisfied customers. That’s
fine. If you know things like your target customer’s job title and company size, you can
look them up directly using Clearbit or LinkedIn Sales Navigator.

When you take this approach, think about what would make them urgently want to
purchase your product: Who’s feeling the most pain?

Look for targets that have just experienced a critical event —a problem that came up
that, if not solved by a certain date, something bad will happen.

Was there a huge fire they had to put out? Is there a meeting where people just left the
company? Did they just get put in charge of a massive budget?

You can find people/companies that have recently experienced a critical event. Start by
looking at the trail these targets leave online. Do they:

● Join specific Facebook groups?
● Have a LinkedIn profile?
● Tweet specific keywords?
● Go on Product Hunt?
● Follow certain GitHub projects?
● Have certain HTML in their website?
● Go to certain conferences/attend webinars? There is often an attendee list that
you can get if you email the organizer.
● Have negative Glassdoor reviews? Have their (former) employees recently
changed job titles on LinkedIn?
● Are they running ads on specific platforms?
● Or hiring for certain positions on Angelist?
Search their online trail and compile a list of names and domains for each prospect.
You’ll create messaging that helps them solve their pain point while writing your emails.

How to Find Email Addresses
Getting email addresses
Once you have a rough prospect list. You’ll need to find the email addresses of each
person in your prospect list in order to reach out.

There are two main ways to find emails:

● Publicly available data : know where to find emails on websites or through
databases.
● Email-finding Tools : software that unlocks emails using other profiles or
information.
We’ll skip the basics and assume you’ve already searched “contact us” and “about”
sections on your target’s website and social media accounts without any luck.

Here are the best ways to find email addresses:

● Lookup services
● Guess
● Twitter
● Mailing lists
Lookup services (and how to scale the process)
Email lookup tools are probably the easiest way to find an email address. Think tools
like Clearbit, Hunter.io, and Apollo.io.

Simply feed them a person’s name and website, and they’ll return an email address for
you.

The best part? This method scales. Here’s how:

Step 1: Build a spreadsheet of the names and domain names of people you’re trying to
contact. There are many ways to do so, but here are a few that we like, depending on
the reason for your outreach:

● Sales : Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator to create a list of targets. You can get lists
of people by job title, industry, company size, seniority, and way way more
criteria. Export the list. When you pair this with a tool like Clearbit or Hunter.io,
you can turn LinkedIn data into emails quickly.
● Sales alternative : Manually create the list using the steps we mentioned above
in finding the right people to target.
● Backlinks for content marketing : Use Ahrefs’ Content Explorer to search for
bloggers in your space. Export the file and you’ll have names and domains.
Step 2: Use Hunter for Sheets to utilize Hunter.io’s email lookup service to get email
addresses for your entire list.

Now you have a targeted list of contacts and emails.

The catch? Even the most effective tools don’t return perfect results. Expect at least
every tenth email address to be incorrect.

Guess
Email addresses are so predictable that you can often guess and get it right.

Since most email addresses follow a standard format, if you know your target’s first
name, last name, and domain, you can find the right email.

The most common format is name@domainname.com

Popular formats include:

● First name: nick@demandcurve.com (please don’t)
● First name and last name: nick.costelloe@demandcurve.com
● First name and initial: nickc@demandcurve.com
● Last name and initial: ncostelloe@demandcurve.com
You can use guessing tools like this or this to generate all possible email addresses.

Once you generate the possible variants (as we did above), you’ll want to validate one
before sending.

So go to Gmail, click “Compose” and paste all the email variants into the “To” field.
Move the cursor over the email address one by one.

A pop-up will show you if the email address is associated with a Google profile.

That’s the email you want.

If you’re looking for further validation before you send, simply Google the email address.
If it exists on the web, it’ll return in searches.

This process is a bit time consuming, so consider hiring a freelancer through Upwork or
Fiverr to do this for you and return a list of confirmed emails.

And if you’re not able to validate particular emails, you could Bcc a number of the
guessed emails you generate.

Another reason to attempt guessing?

If you can find at least one other email from the target company, you can apply that
syntax to your target prospect guess.

Twitter
If your prospects have Twitter accounts, you can leverage Twitter to find their email
addresses.

People occasionally share their emails in tweets, but to keep them hidden from bots,
they replace symbols with words like “dot” and “at”.

So try this:

Go to Twitter Advanced Search.
Search your target person, and include the words “at” and “dot.”
If that doesn’t work, try the words, “email,” “contact,” or “reach” in your search to
narrow down the results.
Another way to leverage Twitter? Reach out to your target directly on Twitter (through a
Tweet or even a DM) and ask for their preferred method of contact. They’ll often prefer
that you reach out to their email address.

Note: This last tactic typically works if you have an active Twitter account and you are
reputable enough that your target is willing to provide their contact information.

Tip from behavioral psychology: When you reach out to people on Twitter first and then
send them an email, they’re more likely to feel obligated to respond.

Mailing lists
If a person you’re targeting has an option to subscribe to a newsletter on their website,
sign up for it.

Most email newsletters come directly from their personal email address.

Then all you need to do is reply to one of the newsletter emails with a quick question.

Even if the newsletter is coming from an email address like, “hello@domain.com” or
“team@domain.com”, your target, if they reply to your reply, will likely do so from their
personal email, not a shared email.

Hacks
If you’re up for a few hacks, try these:

● Going into Facebook groups, cross-referencing the people in them with their
LinkedIn profiles, and using the ContactOut Chrome extension to extract the
email from those profiles.
● Programmatically scraping GitHub for designers who followed specific projects.
● Look in relevant Slack channels (as we indicated in our section on finding the
right people to target). Take the names and companies and run them through
hunter.io to get email addresses.
● Consider purchasing emails wholesale from a reputable vendor (example here).
Once you have a list of emails, run them through a list clearing service like this to make
sure you’re not sending to incorrect email addresses (which will hurt your email
deliverability—covered in this module).

How to Write Emails That Convert
A note on strategy
Archetypes

There’s a strategy for optimizing your cold email open and response rates:

● Create 2-3 high-level archetypes of emails ahead of time.
● Then A/B test them on a portion of the target emails you’ve collected (~100
emails for each archetype is enough).
● Analyze data to see which email had the best reply rate and call booking rate.
● Then send the winning email to the rest of your list.
Here are two email archetypes. These sell a video tool that helps with meetings and
team collaboration:

For each option, you want to create:

A thesis : The style and tone of the email you want to test. Make sure each thesis
considers what sort of behaviour you’re trying to drive:
1. “Humble and inquisitive” tone should drive a booked call from the
prospect.
2. “Educational and value-driven” tone should drive a click through to a
helpful resource.
3. “Straightforward and honest” tone could prompt a quick reply.
Subject options : At least 3 different subject lines. Then choose your favorite by
surveying people on your team.
Body copy : The contents of the email.
Consider sending emails from your founder

You should also consider the “who” behind your email. Are your emails coming from
sales reps? Or your founder?

We’ve found that emails from founders drive action more than those coming from sales
reps. Consider setting up a derivative user account like founder@e.domain.com so that
anyone on your team can send cold emails that look like they’re coming from your
founder.

Now on to creating great body emails.

Personas
To write great emails, you need to understand who you’re writing to. Luckily, you’ve
done a lot of the hard work earlier in finding the right people to talk to.

Now it’s time to dig in and create customer personas. Here’s what you’ll want to know
about your prospect:

● Job title.
● Company size.
● Company location.
● What unique challenge they’re facing.
● What stage of the buyer’s journey they’re at.
● What objections they’ll have that will keep them from buying.
● Who the ultimate decision maker is, if it’s not them.
● What technology they use
If you haven’t already interviewed your best 10-50 customers, do that before you craft
your emails.

Use this information to craft compelling subject lines and body copy.

Say your prospect is the owner of a small business with 10 employees and they need
more clients. You could write the subject, “I’ll help you land five more clients this month”
and create body copy that proves that you did your homework.

Subject line
Subject lines (paired with your domain name) dictate your open rate.

Important: Emails should be measured not just by open rate, but by completion rate on
the desired behavior. Vague or baity subject lines often perform well in terms of open
rate yet fail in terms of conversion. Lower open rates with strong conversion are more
optimal.

Optimize for designed completion rate, not just open rate.

Subject line needs to be:

● Informal : This shouldn’t feel like a typical cold email. You want to distinguish
yourself from the mass of spam that your prospects get in their inboxes each day.
● Concise : Stick with 50 characters or less so that you also optimize for mobile.
Long subject lines are cut off in most ISPs (like Gmail) on mobile.
● Self-evident : We’ve found that self-evident subjects convert best because
prospects generally don’t like guessing what your email is about. But it’s worth
testing slightly opaque subjects if they include sharp hooks and get people to
open and convert.
Subjects need to be relevant to a problem that the reader is currently facing. We
suggest following the guidelines above to start. Then iterate on the versions that
resonate with your audience. Break the rules and see if your open rates and completion
rates are rising.

Good subject lines:

● “Love your work—want to feature you in one of our guides”
● “A creative way to engage students and employers”
● “Seeking advice on [relevant subject]”
● “[Mutual connection] thought we should connect”
● “Advice on making SAAS spending more visible”
● “Controlling SaaS Spend”
● “A Free Facility Management Platform”
● “Trending WFH Benefits”
Bad subject lines:

● “Request to connect”
● “A better way to improve your ROI”
● “Let’s hop on the phone”
● “Check this out”
● “Are you prepared to overcome X?”
● “URGENT”
● “Quick question”
Body copy
Subject lines get people to open, but it’s the body content of the email that will get you
replies and booked meetings.

Body copy should do a few things:

Hook the reader
Explain why you’re reaching out
Predict target customers’ hesitations and objections
Include a personal touch
Include one clear next step
Most importantly, be concise. Try to avoid writing more than 2 sentences per paragraph,
and we’ve found that emails with less than 5 sentences perform best.

Long emails get skimmed. Keep it short and there’s a better chance prospects will read
it.

Hook the reader

The first sentence means everything—it determines whether or not the target will read
the rest of your email.

Here are three ways you can hook readers with your first line:

Ask a question to pique interest: Hey {{first.name}}—curious if you have to log
into a bunch of different places to manage {{company}}’s health insurance, 401K,
FSA / HSA, and other benefits?
Address a pain point: Hey {{first.name}}—I noticed you work with 6 different
vendors to manage {{company}}’s adtech. We can help you manage them all in a
single system, if you’re interested.
Demonstrate clear value: Hey {{first.name}}—want to run something by you that
can help you complete {{insert SaaS thing}} in 2-3 days, instead of 2-3 weeks.
Once you’ve hooked them, win them over within a sentence or two.

Indicate why you’re reaching out

When you send an email to someone who’s never heard of you before, it’s important to
explain why you’re reaching out.

One way to accomplish this is to show the reader that you value what they value:

● I was on your personal site and loved what you wrote about X.
● Just saw your tweet about Y and it made me realize that you’re interested in [the
thing you offer].
● I listened to your podcast interview about Z and I had a follow up question.
● I was on a call with [person they know] and we thought you’d be interested in
this.
● Saw you're working on X problem. I’m also working to improve X.
● I saw you were in the last YC batch and figured I’d reach out. We were in S19.
● Love the idea behind building a more sustainable and eco-friendly business to
improve the world's wastage.
● XYZ stood out while I was browsing through Instagram and I was so impressed I
wanted to reach out.
Brainstorm 2-3 excuses to cold email individuals. Why would someone in your position,
representing your company, reach out to a specific person?

But avoid coming off as salesy. Avoid things like:

● I see you’re a sales professional. Me too.
● Given that we both work at agencies, I thought we should connect.
● I just messaged you on LinkedIn, so I figured I should also email you.
This is where you research the person you’re emailing. Look at their LinkedIn profile,
Facebook profile, personal site, Medium posts, etc. The more you know about them, the
better you can tailor your message.

If you’re strapped for time, there are virtual assistants that research and write intro
sentences for emails for around $1 USD/per intro—and they’re high quality.

Objection handling

Each of your prospects will come armed with objections depending on their stage of the
buyer’s journey. You should be aware of all possible objections, and have calculated
ways in which you handle them proactively :

Objection : Say your prospects continually fail to convert because they think your
product will cost them too much.

Handling : Subtly indicate that your product either doesn’t cost more than competitors or
that your product solves their problem in a better way.

Objection : Or say your prospects drop out of the funnel because they think that it would
take too much time to learn about and integrate your product.

Handling : Concisely explain that your product has a short learning curve, and that
integration is seamless.

This is why you surveyed customers earlier: You learned about their key objections and
now you can repurpose them in cold emails.

Your prospect’s default is to assume that your product is not right for them. You have to
proactively prove that it is.

Make sure you only preemptively handle your biggest objections in cold outreach:

● List your objections in order of severity—which came up most in your surveys?
● Handle the top one or two objections in your emails—only the most obvious
ones.
● Leave out anything trivial—you don’t want to raise awareness to objections that
customers didn’t even know they had.
Lastly, consider using social proof as your objection handling. Most companies won’t
know who you are, so their first and biggest subconscious objection will be that they
don’t trust you. Social proof can help targets trust you, quickly. A few social proof ideas
to test:

● Indicate which competitors you’re already working with.
● Include a one-line testimonial.
● Highlight any relevant names or companies that speak highly of your brand.
● If you’re seeking an investment with your email, consider including your other
investors.
Personal touch

At some point in your body copy, add a personal touch to indicate to your prospect that
you’re not spraying and praying—that you took the time to learn about them.

You can take one of two approaches:

Keep it relevant to work : Signal to the prospect that they’re uniquely fit for your
solution.
1. Since I saw that you invest in startups in addition to your role at Demand
Curve, I thought you’d like this.
2. P.S. we’re in the X Slack group together. Loved your post on referral
programs.
3. We met back at SXSW in 2018. Really enjoyed our chat about XYZ. Glad
you’re doing well!
Get personal : Connect through a personal note that’s unrelated to work. You
might build trust with your prospect. Then they’ll be more likely to buy from you.
1. BTW, saw you played soccer in college. I played at URI. You still playing
these days?
2. One more thing. I saw on your personal site that you make music. I love
music, myself. Actually listened to (name of their song) on spotify. Loved it!
3. [Mutual friend] mentioned you live in SOMA. Even if this isn’t a fit, let’s
grab a coffee one of these days!
4. On a personal note, I see you’re working with Big Brothers Big Sisters. I
volunteer with them myself—one of my favorite projects.
5. P.S. really liked your blog post on climbing Kilimanjaro. Any adventures on
the horizon for this year?
An addition to signaling that you did your homework before reaching out, consider
asking a question to show genuine interest:

E.g. I read your blog post on X. How did you think of that topic?

Do things that demonstrate that your email isn’t automated, and you’re more likely to get
responses.

Tip: You’ll likely have a few critical prospects that require extra personalization. Check to
see if your prospects have social media accounts (Twitter and LinkedIn). Spend a few
minutes on their timeline and get a rough idea about what they’re interested in. Then
add a subtle note leaning into an interest of theirs. There’s a high ROI when you take
10-15 minutes to add a meaningful note for your key prospects.

Pick one CTA

Only include one call to action—the next step your prospect should take after they read
your email. It should feel natural.

You want a next step that is low enough investment so they don’t feel like they’re
rushing into a decision, but compelling enough that they understand how it will help
them solve their problems.

Some examples:

Legal disclaimer

When you send cold emails, make sure you comply with CAN-SPAM rules, which
govern cold emailing in the United States.

(Complying with CAN-SPAM tends to hurt conversion, since it makes cold emails follow
a similar format and people will instinctively screen them out. In particular, having an
“opt-out” link immediately makes your email look like spam and can drastically hurt
conversion.)

Consult a lawyer if you want definite legal advice (we can’t offer it), but they may
recommend following these guidelines at a minimum:

● Don’t use false or misleading header information
● Don’t use deceptive subject lines
● Tell recipients where you’re located with a physical address (this information can
go in your email signature)
● Tell recipients how to opt-out of receiving future email from you.
○ This doesn’t have to be a link. It can be a line in the email asking them to
reply to you directly if they don’t want any more emails from you.
● Honor opt-out requests promptly.
Examples of Great Cold Emails
You become great at writing cold email campaigns by studying quality cold emails. Here
are 8 strong examples of emails that you can use in your own cold outreach.

A note on body copy: We’ve found that plain text emails convert better than emails that
include other content (e.g. distracting images or HTML). And as you’ll read shortly in our
deliverability section, anything other than plain text will reduce the number of inboxes
that you reach. So keep it simple—use text if you can.

1. SaaS Sales
Goal: Book a sales call

Subject: Love your work—think we can grow together

Why it’s great:

● Provides a reason for reaching out : “I see that you’re using MailChimp” and
“I’m confident we can improve the revenue you’re generating from your
newsletter list.”
● Handles key objection : Julian will immediately wonder 1) if Customer IO truly is
better and 2) if it’ll be more expensive. The email handles both objections by
indicating that 1) many other companies are switching over (social proof) and 2)
that they’re less expensive than MailChimp.
● Adds personal touch : “I read your writing guide.”
● One CTA : “Got time for a 15-minute chat...” is a yes/no question. It’s the clear
goal of the email.
2. Podcast request
Goal: Get a reply to schedule a podcast appearance

Subject: Morning Brew Podcast (1.5M Listeners)

Why it’s great:

● Gave a reason for reaching out : Indicates why he’s reaching out without fluff.
● Handles key objection : Mark Cuban wants a high ROI on his time. Mentioning
1.5M downloads is social proof that handles Mark’s objection, “Is it worth my
time?”
● Adds personal touch : “As someone who read your book when I was growing
up...” is personal and proves to Mark that the email isn’t automated. It’s
thoughtful.
● One CTA : “Would you be down to do a podcast...” is a yes/no question. It’s the
clear goal of the email.
3. Investment request
Goal: Book a call to discuss angel investment

Subject: [Company name] x Pre-seed

Why it’s great:

● Gave a reason for reaching out : Nick indicates that they’re looking for pre-seed
investment.
● Handles key objection : Any investor will immediately wonder if the startup has
traction. Nick handles the object by mentioning that they have 12,000 members
in a pilot.
● Adds personal touch : “I’m in the Demand Curve community” and “You are one
of three angels I have cold emailed” are two personal touches that ensure that
the email isn’t automated.
● One CTA : “If the above is a fit, let’s chat” is a simple CTA that, if effective, will get
Julian to respond so Nick can schedule a call.
● De-risked : “I’ll share my top community building insights...” de-risks a call. Even
if it doesn’t work out, there’s something in it for Julian.
4. Feedback request
Goal: Book a call or get a reply

Subject: Reaching out from S20 - [Sender name]

Why it’s great:

● Clear reason for reaching out : “I’m trying to learn a little more about how teams
use [competitor products]”
● Handles key objection : Subject line and body (hidden to cover company name)
include “S20,” indicating that Nick is part of a YC company and is therefore a
vetted entrepreneur. It’s social proof that handles the objection, “Why should I get
on the phone with you?”
● Adds personal touch : “...thought this might be a good fit considering that
Demand Curve has a webapp” includes information about Julian’s company
which proves that Nick has done research.
● One CTA : Nick asks for a call and links to Calendly. He also offers the alternative
to chat via email, which could be an attractive option that prompts a quicker
response. Calls are often daunting for people. Email is easier. Either way, he’s
simply requesting a response.
● De-risked : “I can share some tactics that are so insightful you’ll want to use them
for Demand Curve’s newsletter” makes the call valuable for Julian.
● A note on linking calendars: You could be a bit more polite and say something
along the lines of, "Please let me know some times that work for you, or if it's
easier, feel free to book a time for yourself here."
5. Building a portfolio
Goal: Get high quality case studies

Subject: Cold Email As A Service 💌

Why it’s great:

● Clear reason for reaching out : To provide a free service in exchange for case
studies.
● Handles key objection : Andrew is offering a completely free service.
● Adds personal touch : Mentioning that he already has 7 YC companies on
board is personal because Demand Curve is also a YC company.
● One CTA : “Would you be interested?” is a yes/no question prompting a reply.
6. Switch from a competitor
Goal: Book a call

Subject: [Name], still in love with [competitor]?

Why it’s great:

● Clear reason for reaching out : The sender saw that the prospect was using a
competitor’s tool. She’s reaching out to highlight why Activecampaign is a better
tool.
● Handles key objection : She explains that Activecampaign could do more for
this prospect and a lower price than the competitor. Handles the objection, “Will
this cost more?”
● Adds personal touch : Mentioning that Activecampaign integrates with Thinkific
shows the prospect that the email is meant specifically for them since they use
Thinkific to run online courses.
● One CTA : She asks for a phone call and links an easy way for the prospect to
book time with her. It’s a clear request.
● De-risked : “I’ll provide some new email marketing tactics...” de-risks the call for
Julian, since he’ll get something out of it regardless.
7. SaaS sales 2
Goal: Book a call

Subject: thought I’d reach out, [first name]

Credit: https://www.lemlist.com/lotw/felix-sim

Why it’s great:

● Clear reason for reaching out : This is relevant to you if you need help
organizing virtual corporate events.
● Handles key objection : Including a screenshot of the product de-risks the
prospect’s time replying: they’ll reply if they have the problem and like the
design/functionality that they see in the screenshot.
● Incorrect—fails to personalize : If there’s one area where this email falls short,
it’s in personalization. They don’t include a line that makes the recipient feel like
the message was uniquely for them.
● One CTA : Emie asks for a phone call and links an easy way for the prospect to
book time with her. It’s a clear request.
8. SaaS sales 3
Goal: Book a call

Subject: Lunch on me?

Important note: This is a follow up email. We’ll get into follow ups shortly, but the email
body copy itself is worth examining at this point.

Why it’s great:

● Clear reason for reaching out : They tried reaching out before, and they have a
product that the prospect might find value in.
● Handles key objection : Uses social proof “IBM, Salesforce, Oracle” and also
incentivizes prospects with a DoorDash gift card—ultimately getting more
prospects to reply that otherwise would ignore.
● Personalization : While this email fails to include a personal note, the tone feels
personal—like a friend reaching out. In instances where your list is too big to
personalize, consider adding a single emoji to come across as lighthearted and
playful.
One CTA : Asks the prospect for a phone call on Friday afternoon.

Sending Cold Emails
Quick note before we dive into sending strategies: You should send yourself test emails
and look at them on desktop and mobile devices before sending to your prospect list.

Where are the line breaks? Should there be more or less? Do you have a stellar first
sentence above the fold on a mobile device? Everyone skims—if you write an email that
can be skimmed and easily understood, then you’ll get better results.

Now, when it comes to actually sending cold emails, there are a few questions you want
to answer.

How do I make sure that my emails are getting delivered?
How many emails should I send?
What tool should I use to send them?
Deliverability
Deliverability is the percentage of emails that make it to inboxes (as opposed to spam
folders or firewalls).

High deliverability is necessary for a successful cold outreach strategy. Think: you’ve
done all the hard work of finding the right targets, getting their email addresses, and
crafting emails to them accordingly. It’s inefficient if many of your emails don’t even
make it to inboxes.

Here’s the 80/20 on improving your deliverability. Don’t skip these steps:

Create a separate subdomain for sending cold emails. For example, if your usual
email is jsmith@company.com, set up a separate subdomain and use
jsmith@e.company.com to actually send emails from. This way, if anything goes
wrong (rare), you haven’t trashed your main domain.
Avoid spam filters by avoiding keywords commonly used in spam emails. This is
less important than how your recipients engage with your emails, but it’s still
worth avoiding these words.
Follow all legal advice we mentioned earlier.
Most importantly, get your targeting right. You improve deliverability by getting a
high rate of replies, and low rate of unsubscribes and spam reports. So only send
emails to people you truly think will benefit from your product.
A few additional strategies that will help improve your deliverability over time:

Don’t batch-send all your appointment reminders and follow ups at once. Stretch
them out over a few hours or over the day.
Avoid including too many images or too much HTML in your emails. One of the
spam flags that you can avoid is the ratio of text to other content.
Limit your links—especially to social networking sites. And try to avoid bit.ly and
other link shorteners as they’ll get picked up by spam flags.
You can also use a tool like Mailwarm to get positive engagements on your emails
before you start sending at scale. What you’re looking for is "regular email traffic" and a

responsible slope to higher volumes that won’t negatively impact your sender
reputation.

Here are two useful tools to help you keep tabs on deliverability:

Glock: This helps you check how your emails are inboxing (how many inboxes you’re
reaching). Ideally, cold emails make it to the primary tab and not the promotions tab.

Postmaster Tools: Gmail's feedback loop tool. This helps you understand how Gmail
recipients are interacting with your emails.

Email Cadence
Let’s revisit our cold email strategy from earlier:

You’ve already created your 2-3 emails. Let’s assume that you have a list of about 1,000
prospect’s email addresses to send to.

Here’s the most effective way to run your first campaign:

Start with an initial test run: an A/B of the 2-3 email archetypes you’ve created
(~100 emails for each archetype is enough).
Analyze data to see which email had the best reply rate and booked meetings
rate. Then send the winning email to the rest of your list.
Continuously iterate on your emails.
First test run: 100-300 emails (~100 per archetype)

You need to send enough emails to reliably know what percentage of your emails get
opened , and what percentage of your prospects take action— whether it’s scheduling a
call with you, emailing you back, or just clicking through to your website.

Sure. You could conduct a statistical test if you want to get technical. But considering
the fact that you’ll want to quickly test your archetypes and start sending your winning
email, a good proxy is a test of 100-150 emails total.

We’ve found that’s often all it takes to find your winning email, measured by response
rate.

Second run: 800-1,000 emails

Send the winning email to the rest of your list. The goal, first and foremost, is to get
prospects to take action on your email. But the secondary goal is to validate the results
you got from your first test run.

What you’re looking for here is whether or not the metrics from your first test hold true at
scale—and we’ll cover those metrics, but think: open rate, reply rate, action rate, etc.

Future runs: Find the cadence that works best for your business

Once you have a tight grip on your metrics, you’ll know how many emails you need to
send to get a reasonable flow of leads. Think: You might find out that, instead of sending
emails in bursts, it works better to send out 50-100 emails per day per sales rep which
should result in roughly 10 new leads per day. If you need more / fewer leads per sales
rep each day, you can simply change the cadence.

As you scale, make sure your emails stay personalized, and continuously iterate on the
copy you use to improve your metrics.

We’ll cover metrics shortly, but one important note to keep in mind as you find your ideal
sending cadence: Most businesses would benefit by maximizing ROI, not purely
revenue. High ROI is usually achieved in smaller batches when you can afford taking
the time to personalize.

Follow ups

If someone hasn’t responded to you after your first email, follow up twice:

● Once after 3 days
● And again after 7 days
After that, it’s not usually worth continuing. You might find data suggesting that you
follow up 3+ times (some blogs suggest following up over 9 times).

We disagree. After your 3rd unanswered email, you’re no longer simply being
persistent—you’re being a pest. The damage you’ll do to your brand by spamming
people exceeds the marginal benefit of a few additional sales.

We’re building self-aware businesses. Stick with 2 follow ups and don’t spam.

Another reason for limiting your touches: You can recycle these leads sooner. A lead
that doesn't respond to a 3 touch sequence can be emailed again in 5-6 months.

Automate your follow ups through tools like Mixmax, PersistIQ, Mailshake, or Lemlist.
These tools automate multi-email campaigns, and personalize each for the recipient.
They also detect when a prospect replies so they’re taken out of the sequence and
shielded from receiving more emails.

Make sure your follow ups accomplish the following:

● Add value to your original email. Don’t waste your prospects’ time with emails
that read, “following up on this.” Instead, make sure each of your follow ups adds
a bit of value.
○ “Here’s a video walkthrough of our tool.”
○ “Here’s a case study on how XYZ brand is working with us.”
● End with a question, not a statement. This tends to open up more
conversations that would otherwise go to closed-lost.
○ “What’s holding you back from exploring this?”
○ “Are you still facing XYZ problem?”
You want to build credibility until your prospect can’t help but respond.

Tools
We recommend using Gmail and something that sits on top of Gmail and sends through
it.

As you scale up, you can level up and afford bigger and more powerful tools.

When you’re sending thousands of emails, you’ll want to automate most of the process.
Luckily, there are many tools that allow you to automate your emailing: Simply upload a
list, copy and paste your emails (and follow ups) into the tool, add personalization where
necessary, and send.

Here’s a list of what we’ve used in the past to send emails for clients:

● PersistIQ: Free to start.
○ Free plan: 20 emails/day
○ Growth plan: 300 emails/day/user
○ Enterprise: 600 emails/day/user
● Streak: Free to start.
○ Free plan: 50 emails/day/user
○ Solo plan: 800 emails/day/user
○ Pro plan: 1,500 emails/day/user
● Mixmax: Inexpensive, and it can be directly integrated into Gmail.
○ G Suite customers can send up to 2000 emails per day
○ But Mixmax caps you at 500/day to prevent senders from getting
rate-limited by Google
● Mailshake: Easy to use, best for people who are just starting out in cold outreach.
○ Sending via Gmail, Mailshake limits you to 500 emails/day/user
● Reply IO: Another easy to use tool, and, unlike all others on this list, it has basic
functionalities that can help you to create onboarding or retention drip
campaigns.
○ Reply IO caps you at 400 emails/day/user
● Lemlist: Similar to Mailshake with better personalization and email deliverability.
○ Lemlist recommends sending no more than 200 emails/day/user
Your sending tools should integrate with a CRM to make tracking easy. We recommend
Pipedrive and Copper for their ease of use and integrations with the tools above.

Measure and Optimize Results
Measuring results boils down to one question: How much does it cost to get a
purchase through cold email?

If your cost of acquiring a customer (CAC) is less than the amount of money you make
from each customer, you’ve validated a channel and you’re ready to scale up.

Below are additional metrics that will help you increase your cold email performance,
and, thus, decrease your CAC.

Time Spent Per Purchase
Gather a rough estimate of how much time it took you to source, send and respond to
all of your initial emails.

For example, say it takes you:

● 4 hours to source 100 email addresses.
● 3 hours to send and personalize them.
● Another 3 hours to respond before closing.
You spent 10 hours total. If one person purchased out of all of those emails, You’ve
spent 10 hours per purchase.

You can use hours per purchase to figure out whether it’s worth hiring a salesperson or
a sales team. Be sure to factor in costs for tools (like Hunter.io or Lemlist). While
relatively marginal compared to labor, they should be included in your ROI calculation.

An average account executive in the United States costs about $100,000 per year
including benefits—that’s about $50/hour.

If it takes 10 sales hours per purchase, it costs you $500 per purchase to hire an
Account Executive.

If your product’s profit exceeds that, it’s worth hiring.

Note: All percentages below are a percentage of the initial cold emails sent. Numbers
are drawn from our experience sending thousands of cold emails for 50+ startups.
Percentages will vary based on your business type and your audience, but these are
rough benchmarks.

Open rate
The percentage of emails opened.

In cold outreach, open rate is a measure of how enticing your subject line is.

You can improve your open rate by A/B testing your subject line. Before you email your
entire prospect list, send a portion of your list (say, 100 people) two different subject
lines. Then send the rest of your list the subject line that had a higher open rate.

We’ve sent thousands of cold emails for clients, and we’ve found the following metrics
to be true:

Average open rate: 20-30%. Good open rate: 30-50%. Outstanding open rate: 50%+.

Click-through rate
Click-through rate (CTR) is the percentage of emails sent where the recipient clicked an
embedded link.

This is a measure of how enticing your email body is, whether you’ve included a clear
CTA, and whether you’ve emailed the right people.

Note: Keep in mind that using software to track your click-through rate will impact your
deliverability—internet service providers (like Gmail) don’t like tracking software. So
recording anything more than opens can hurt deliverability.

Our suggestion: Start with tracking. Get a handle on your numbers. Then decide if using
tracking is worth the potential decline in deliverability.

Average CTR: 3-5%. Good CTR: 5-10%. Outstanding CTR: 10%+.

Response rate
Response rate is the percentage of your list that responds to your emails.

This is a measure of how enticing your email body and website are combined with how
well you created your targeted prospect list.

In addition, response rate is higher when targets already know who you are (e.g.
pre-targeting covered below). If the goal of your cold outreach is to book meetings, this
is the most important metric—you need booked calls to close sales.

Average response rate: 5-10%. Good response rate: 10-20%. Outstanding response
rate: 20%+.

Purchase Rate
Purchase rate is the percent of cold contacts who eventually purchase from you.

For most cold outreach, this metric measures your end goal of acquiring customers.
Even though purchases may take a lot of back-and-forth and take longer than a week,
make sure you’re tracking this diligently—this is how you prove your cold outreach ROI.

If you see high response and click-through rates, but low purchase rates, you’ll want to
improve your sales funnel after the initial email.

Average purchase rate: 0.5%-1%. Good purchase rate: 1-2%. Outstanding purchase
rate: 2%+.

Pre-targeting
Cold outreach performs best when your targets already know who you are.

Two ways to make that happen:

You earn that reputation by building an online following and a strong user base.
Or you pre-target your prospects. Target them with ads before you reach out—at
least until your brand is a household name.
Pretargeting is running ads to a specific list of email addresses before reaching out to
them.

It boosts open rates and response rates, especially when you’re targeting people who
need to establish more trust and care about your brand. This tends to be folks in larger,
older companies, or slow-moving industries.

Think about every time you’ve seen an ad. When you see an ad, the product in it feels
more “legitimate.” While irrational, we subconsciously believe that the company must be
big enough to invest money into an ad campaign.

Facebook and LinkedIn are great because you can upload real lists of emails, and
enough people use the site that a high percentage of them match. So you can serve
ads to the exact individual people you want.

Pre-targeting industries
Here’s a list of industries that fit well for pre-targeting (larger, older, slower-moving
industries):

● Government
● Construction
● Procurement
● Entertainment
● Hospitals
● Aviation
● Manufacturing
● Supply Chain
● Recruiting
● Real Estate
How to pre-target
You’ll want to test whether pre-targeting actually matters in your industry; otherwise,
your ads will have a low ROI.

● Pull a list of 500 to 1000 emails using the strategies you just learned. This is
Group A.
● Then, pull a list of another list of 500 to 1000 emails using the same strategies.
This is Group B.
● Run ads on LinkedIn and Facebook and directly upload the Group A list (you’ll
want to use “Direct Audiences”).
● In contrast, email Group B without running ads.
● See which group responds and converts better—does pre-targeting help?
● After your ads hit a frequency of 7-10—meaning they’ve been shown to everyone
on your list 7-10 times—go ahead and send your cold email campaign.
Since your prospect list is likely full of work emails, you might need to take one
additional step to pre-target effectively. People usually use their personal emails to sign
up for LinkedIn and Facebook, so you’ll likely need personal emails to run direct ads
directly to your prospects. To solve this, you can use Clearbit Advertising to run ads to
the prospects who you will reach out to on LinkedIn. Clearbit Advertising takes your list
of work emails, enriches the data to match work emails to the right LinkedIn and
Facebook accounts, and then generates audiences for you to run your campaigns on.

For a less-expensive alternative, try Primer.

LinkedIn has turned into a viable B2B sales channel. So we decided to write an entire
(public) guide to acquiring customers through LinkedIn.

The main advantage of LinkedIn is its "firmographic" data: business and employee
information you can target by. No other social network has this level of specificity and
consumption context.

LinkedIn is primarily a top-of-funnel channel—you won’t see many deals close directly
on LinkedIn. Instead, LinkedIn should be treated as a tool to find relevant prospects,
engage with them (via content and DMs) and get permission to email them. That’s when
prospects turn into warm leads.

The LinkedIn strategy looks like this:

Contribute meaningfully to LinkedIn's content pool.
Acquire LinkedIn followers from posting that good content.
Build trust with those followers.
Get their email addresses.
Email them to get off-platform conversion.
If you’re interested in testing LinkedIn organic as a channel, read the guide here. You’ll
eventually acquire warm leads and repeat the email process we discussed earlier—with
additional personalization.

Project: Cold Outreach
This project walks you through a test cold email campaign, from start to finish.

Phase 1: Find emails
Use what you’ve learned from the readings to figure out scalable ways to get email
addresses of potential customers.

Are you going to be using a tool like Clearbit? Scraping websites? Cross-referencing
Crunchbase with LinkedIn? Reference our reading on how to find emails as you go.

This will involve a lot of research. If you can’t find real, living and breathing emails, you
need to keep searching. At Demand Curve, it usually take us multiple days of research
to come up with viable strategies.

Come up with at least three strategies that result in real emails.

Don’t stop until you have at least four real email addresses within each strategy you
come up with. That's at least twelve emails total.

This helps us prove that your approach is good enough to do at scale.

Don’t spend time getting more than the first four emails. Only gather enough to
prove your approach can work. We'll generate giant lists later.

Put the emails you found in a spreadsheet and save them.

Phase 2: Draft your strategy document
Draft a document in Dropbox Paper that answers the following questions:

Who will I be targeting?
Include job titles, company size, and anything else that is relevant when it comes to
finding their email or tailoring the message they get.

Improve your targeting by drilling deeper into their pain points and where they are in the
customer journey (use your value props).

How will I be getting their emails?
Pull this from Phase 1.

What does an initial test look like?
How many emails should you send to start? How will you know if you’ve succeeded?
What’s the next step after the initial email?

Check out the example strategy document in Cold Outreach – Additional Resources >
Outbound Strategy Document based on what Demand Curve has given a real client
(identifying details removed).

Phase 3: Write copy
Draft up a document with the initial cold email copy. Make sure you’ve read our Email
Copy reading first.

Make two versions that have a very different message from each other. Within those,
make a long and a short version.

Go to Cold Outreach – Additional Resources > Templates: Cold Email Copy for some
email templates. You can use the same overall layout as the templates, but craft your
own emails. Only reference the copy when you get stuck — good copy varies
market-to-market.

Phase 4: Test on yourself
Send an email to yourself in Gmail. Put yourself in the shoes of a prospect receiving the
email. See if it looks spammy.

Look at the snippet you see in the inbox first.

Then open the actual email. At Demand Curve, we’ll actually boomerang the email to
ourselves to be sent in a day, so it looks fresher when we actually read it.

Make sure everything looks compelling. If not, change what needs to be changed.

Phase 5 (optional): Test that you don’t
go to spam
Use Glock or Litmus to double-check that your emails will pass your recipient’s spam
filter.

Generally, you won’t have to worry about this until you’re sending emails out on a
massive scale (1000+ emails/day).

Make sure to cancel Litmus before your free trial is up or they’ll charge you a boatload.

Phase 6: Gather emails
Make sure you have at least 100 emails of prospects loaded into a spreadsheet. Go
through each prospect, research them, and add a blurb about how you’ll personalize
your email to them in a separate column.

Anything less than 100 emails means you won’t get reliable data.

Phase 7: Make safety email address
When you send your initial test emails, there’s a small chance your address will go to
spam or get blacklisted. You’ll want to create a separate subdomain for sending cold
emails so that if anything goes wrong (rare), it won't trash your main domain.

Have this be for the highest-ranking person at the company — ideally the CEO if you
have their permission. Emails from them tend to get much better response rates.

For example, if your usual email is jsmith@company.com, make a separate email
address for jsmith@e.company.com to actually send emails from.

This way, if anything goes wrong (rare), you haven’t trashed your main email. Great.

Next, upload a picture of the person whose email you’re using, otherwise the account
will look fake when people mouse over their name in gmail. This boosts response rates
30-50%.

Phase 8: Learn mail merge
Now, install Yet Another Mail Merge. We’re going to test safely that we can send out
multiple emails, without emailing another human being.

Make a Google Sheet like below:

Add only your own email address , and then add one that’s generated from Mailinator.
Don’t use real email addresses yet.

Follow steps 2 and 3 here.

Then, go to your email and the Mailinator inbox. Double-check that the emails looks
how they should.

Phase 9: Checklist
Follow this checklist. It’s what we use internally at Demand Curve.

Phase 10: Go live
Add the real emails of your prospects to the Google Sheet. Plug in the right variables.
Send away.

Use Mail Merge or send manually through Gmail if you need the flexibility to personalize
your emails on the fly. We recommend using Gmail to start and backing into using Mail
Merge if it’s too time-consuming.

And see those sweet, sweet leads start to come in!

Phase 11: Get data
The more expensive your product, the longer it tends to take to get good data, since
people may take a long time to actually purchase and move through your funnel.

Check back after 4-5 days.

Then, make a spreadsheet with all the important data you need (hint: it’s in our reading
on Sending Cold Emails). Figure out whether it’s profitable for you to continue.

Example: Outbound Strategy Document
Overview
This document covers who we’ll be emailing, how we’re getting their emails, and what
our initial tests will look like. We can scale up if we see success.

Audiences
People who have indicated interest in premium dog products. Specifically, there are two
main audiences we’ll be starting with:

● High-end dog owners in the Dog Food Lovers Slack group.
● Participants in dog-food related conversations in the Doggie Moms Google
group.
Email Harvesting
Dog Food Lovers

We’ve written a scraper to programmatically go through their Slack channel and pull the
emails for the owners from each profile. Here is an initial list. First tab.

Demand Curve Note: above would be a link to a spreadsheet with the list of emails;
we've removed it from this example doc.

Doggie Moms

We’ve joined the Google group and exported the list of participants from the “Members”
section of the admin panel.

Initial Test
Start by sending LinkedIn InMail. You’re going to send 10 inMails, total, to start.

You’ll have to purchase a Premium subscription to do this. You only get a fixed number
of InMails per month, but it looks like you can purchase more if you run out.

At the same time, try cold-emailing people directly. You’re going to send 10 emails, total,
to start.

When you send cold emails, you may want to comply with CAN-SPAM rules, which
govern cold emailing in the United States.

Complying with CAN-SPAM tends to hurt conversion, since it makes cold emails
follow a similar format and people will instinctively screen them out. But we leave
that choice up to you.

Consult a lawyer if you want definite legal advice (we can’t offer it), but they would
recommend following these guidelines at a minimum:

● Don’t use false or misleading header information
● Don’t use deceptive subject lines
● Tell recipients where you’re located with a physical address (this information can
go in your email signature)
● Tell recipients how to opt-out of receiving future email from you.
● This doesn’t have to be a link. It can be a line in the email asking them to reply to
you directly if they don’t want any more emails from you.
● Honor opt-out requests promptly.
You can read more here or read the original text if you really want some bedtime
material.

Don’t reach out to more than 20 Dog Food Lovers to start, since folks are going to
catch on quickly and if they talk to each other, we’ll start to look like spam.

Stagger out the emails, sending only 1 or 2 per day.

We need our outreach to be natural. Since we know that pet owners tell other pet
owners about Fictitious Dog Chow, you can “land and expand” without actually sending
many emails. You’ll ask for owners to refer other owners, in person, at the end of their
trial if it goes well.

We’ll rely on further emails as a crutch, not as a centerpiece of our outreach strategy.

However, it’s safer to email owners who are broadly dog owners, or in a more publicly
available Slack channel. We’ve scraped a list of these owners: the 1000 most recent
participants in the Doggie Moms Slack channel. They’re in the second tab of the sheet.

Make sure you haven’t already reached out to these people when you email them (the
Dog Food Lovers are in the same list).

Aim for people who were active in the last month. We’re planning to segment this list
further in the future to find past dog food purchasers and pet owners who are closer to

buying gourmet. If you send out too many similar emails from Gmail per day, it will start
marking you as spam and blacklist your domain (usually once you’re in the hundreds).
So you need to be careful about not sending too many.

Email response rates over 10% are considered good. The best we’ve ever seen is
~50%, with targeting even better than what we have here.

Content
It’s going to come off as creepy if you say that you know owners are in the Dog Food
Lovers group. You’ll need to write a subject line enticing enough to make them click, but
have a convincing enough excuse for why you’re reaching out to get them to respond.

You’ll mention Dog Food Lovers as an aside in the email, but not make it the focus.

Stick to the templates we’ve written pretty closely if you can. We’ve spent hours
perfecting these.

For the variables that you’re plugging in:

● Find any public information indicating that they're a Dog Food Lover.
● This is ideal and the most straightforward.
● For example, there are a few owners who already list that they have a dog in
their Twitter profile. You’ll want to check those.
● Install the Clearbit Connect. Plug in their email. See what shows up.
● Look through their LinkedIn.
● Google them. Reference Tweets/Blog Posts/Social Media that indicated they’re
interested in premium dog food.
● Reference their city and talk about how gourmet dog food has gotten rave
reviews there.
● Research anything else you can about them to give you a compelling excuse to
reach out.
● In general, you’ll want to do three things to write high-converting emails:
● Make them feel like the email is personalized to them in the context they read it.
By context, we mean Gmail, a mail app, or LinkedIn.
● Immediately entice them with a solution to their problem.
● Close with a clear next step.
You need to hook owners with the subject line and first blurb they read.

Emails read very differently in Dropbox Paper than they do in Gmail or LinkedIn, so
send yourself a sample email in Gmail before sending out to see what the emails will
actually look like.

Templates: Cold Email Copy
Subject Lines
The best subject lines are tailored to the specific person you’re emailing (notice a
theme? 🙂)

If you’re looking to try a few more variations, here are some examples. We generally
capitalize the first word and keep the rest of the subject lowercase to make it look more
conversational. Keep subject lines short.

● Dog food factory tour?
● Pancake’s diet
● Dog food
● Factory tour?

Pal, my German Shepherd, got sick from mass-market dog food too. I wanted
something healthier for him.

I saw you’re in the Bay Area — I’d love to invite you and Pancake to tour our factory in
Fremont if you're around. It’d be totally free. Most owners (and dogs) get a kick out of it.

If this sounds cool, I can share the address, or even connect you with some other
owners who have done it.

For context: I founded Fictitious Dog Chow to be an organic, healthier dog food. We’ve
helped many dogs with weak stomachs enjoy their meals. I found you because I look
through {Instagram} to find pet owners to help out.

Introduction
Questions answered in this module
● What are the different virality types?
● Which type is best for our product/brand?
● If an incentives program is best for us, what kind of incentive should I offer?
● What kinds of tools can I use to create virality?
Overview
What is it about your product that makes it “spread” from user to user? Why would users
want—or even feel the need—to share it?

Virality is what happens when people spread the word about a product while using it. It’s
user-spread growth.

There are four virality types. The first three are “organic”—they happen naturally
through product use. The last one is “inorganic” because it involves an incentive.

● Word-of-mouth virality: when users tell others about a product because they
like it so much.
● Pull virality: when users invite others to a product because it improves their
experience of that product, or because the product has little or no value unless
others are on it (e.g., Slack, PayPal, Zoom, and Facebook are all better with
others).
● Push virality: when real-world product usage increases its exposure.
● Incentivized virality: when users are incentivized to invite others to a product,
for instance through cash, a discount, or rewards points. This is the virality type
that typical referral programs belong to.
Any of these can lead to customer acquisition—and a lower CAC.

In the startup world, virality is highly desirable. It increases a brand’s recognition,
popularity, and user base. (The origin of the term—viruses going “viral”—isn’t quite as
positive, but it does paint a picture of how quickly something can spread through
increased exposure.)

The measure marketers use here is the viral coefficient : the number of people a user
recommends or exposes a product to who actually buy. If your average user gets three
other people to buy from you, your coefficient is three.

No matter what type of virality works for your product, you want to avoid coercing users
into referring it. They'll need to want to do it on their own. That's the key to virality.

We’ll help you understand if virality can be a major producer of growth for your
company, and if so, which tactic(s) are best suited for you.

Client story
One of our clients is a coding bootcamp that trains people to get entry-level software
engineering jobs in months. One of the big revenue drivers we found for them was a
referral strategy. But it’s not a traditional one.

Specifically, we had instructors email students right after they accepted a job offer. The
timing was key—at that point, their satisfaction with the program was at its peak.

They asked the student if they had any friends whose lives would genuinely change
from the program. They made it easy for the student to make a personal introduction by
forwarding an email.

This simple strategy became a referral engine for them.

Not all referral programs require a referral link or monetary incentive.

Word-of-Mouth Virality
When something has word-of-mouth virality, its users love it so much that they talk
about it. To friends, family, maybe even strangers.

Word of mouth is organic. The people spreading the word aren’t getting any incentive,
and they’re not being asked to do it.

People think this type of virality is largely out of their control.

That’s partly true. You can’t force people to talk about your product. To get word of
mouth, your product has to be so good that people want to talk about it. It has to be
“remarkable”—in that someone would remark about it to a friend.

But there are some things that are under your control when it comes to making your
product remarkable.

We’ll provide a few examples:

● Add a personal touch to your customer journey.
● Respond to negative reviews.
● Find out what customers are saying about your brand.
● Collect NPS data.
Add an insanely personal touch
Make your customer journey as remarkable as possible.

A few examples:

Minerva University: To let students know they got in, Minerva, a startup university,
shipped every accepted student an iPad. It automatically opened a live video chat with
the CEO to congratulate them.

Vanhawks sells super high-end bikes. What worked for them? Sending TaskRabbits
into offices, with bikes for employees to ride on the spot. Think people weren’t going to
tell their co-workers about the free bike ride they had that day?

Netflix: Check out this clever variation on a cease and desist.

Messaging like that could convert users—and even prospects—into brand advocates.
Netflix subscribers who get the references and inside jokes will delight in the
connections they feel.

Each of those is remarkable. Each strengthens brand-product fit and brand-market
fit.

The constraint on offering a personal touch is how many resources you can reasonably
pour into doing it. Don’t exceed your target CAC.

Here are some ideas for making it personal on a reasonable budget. These would work
for a B2B company with the goal of increasing lead conversion through sales outreach:

● Selling to a CMO who runs a food blog? Use Postmates to deliver high-end
treats to them.
● Send leads a handwritten letter using handwrite.io.
● Send them a book you know they’ll like.
● Have your team deliver each purchase by hand.
Those types of initiatives aren’t directly baked into your product. In that sense, you have
less control over them. But they may inspire leads to become customers—and to tell
their friends about your company.

Respond to negative reviews
Go on Yelp, Trustpilot, the App Store, Amazon, etc.—anywhere people review you.

Find every four-star review or lower within the past two months. Respond to them.
Address their concerns with clear next steps.

Don’t say: “We hear you! This is a known problem with our app.”

Instead, say: “Yes, X totally is/was a problem. We’re currently doing Y to fix it, and it’s
scheduled to go live on October 8th. Super sorry this happened to you. We’d love to
follow up through email about what we can do to make you feel better.”

In-progress fixes, timelines, and personal follow-ups go over much better than canned
responses without solutions. Think about everyone reading the review and your
response. Do you want them to think your app is bad? Or do you want them to think it’s
getting better and there’s a human on the other end?

Thoughtful responses don’t just show that you’re invested in your product and its
constant improvement. Just as importantly, they also show that you’re invested in your
audience. Readers will appreciate your openness, honesty, and willingness to
listen—and they might go tell their networks that your brand is the real deal.

Go undercover where your customers hang out
Log in to the Slack channels, forums, and Facebook groups where your customers hang
out (or pay a friend, TaskRabbit, or Upwork freelancer to do it). See what people are
saying about your company. If you’ve enlisted a friend or freelancer, have them ask,
“Has anyone here used {your company}? Curious whether you’d recommend it.”

Second level: Find individual people in the group who seem knowledgeable about your
space. Have a friend send them a message saying, “Hey, saw in the group that it seems

like you know a lot about {product space}. I’m thinking of trying {company name}. Know
anything about it?”

The goal is not to spread the word about your product.

The goal is to measure whether people like your product enough to talk about it.

If people talk about negative experiences, it’s directly affecting your revenue. Fix the
issues.

Use an NPS score to figure out if your product needs to
improve
What it is

Your NPS—“net promoter score"—is how likely people are to refer your company to a
friend or colleague. You can find out your score by distributing a customer survey.

There are precise words to use in your survey. You’ve probably seen them in a bajillion
emails. Like this:

The reason every company on earth uses this messaging is that there’s a ton of
industry data on what the answers mean if you word the question that way. To get an
accurate read on your NPS, avoid deviating from the standard language.

Calculate your NPS by subtracting the percentage of respondents who are detractors
from the percentage who are promoters.

If 50% of your customers are promoters and 10% are detractors, your NPS is 40.

An NPS above 50 is considered excellent. From 0-50 is average. Below 0 is a really bad
sign—you’ll need to fix things.

How NPS affects word of mouth

Your NPS is helpful as a benchmark. It gives you an idea of how remarkable your
product is now, compared to its norm. We generally recommend setting up a dashboard
to track NPS every couple of weeks.

For bootstrapped companies (meaning: the founders have funded the whole thing
themselves), NPS is particularly important. You’re probably already relying on word of
mouth, and you may be competing against much larger, better-funded companies. If
your word of mouth suffers, things get a whole lot more expensive.

For example, Tuft & Needle, a bootstrapped mattress company, started off by running
Google ads and posting on Reddit, then accelerated that with amazing word of mouth.
This let them compete with VC-funded companies that spent twice as much on
marketing. Within five years, they grew to $300 million in annual revenue.

They religiously measure their NPS to make sure their product stays great. And
recommendable.

How to implement an NPS survey

Don’t send an NPS survey until users can form an in-depth opinion of your product.
Usually, this means waiting until after a purchase or free trial.

There are two places to ask the NPS question:

● In your app or platform
● In an email
Do both.

In-app, you tend to get more responses, but you’re interrupting users’ workflow. Make
sure the question doesn’t add friction. It should take only one click and two seconds.

Ask the question after the user has seen the value of your product: after their purchase,
booking, trial, etc. We recommend adding it to a thank-you page, with an incentive for
filling it out (such as a future discount).

In an email, you’re not interrupting people as much. You’re also reaching customers
who are less active in your app, making your score more accurate. Send the email in
plain text, with a short link to the survey. Gmail tends to filter out emails with a ton of
logos, color, and structure as “promotions” or spam.

Here’s another example of an NPS email.

Subject: Feedback?

We like Delighted and Promoter.io for setting up NPS surveys. Typeform and
SurveyMonkey are also good survey management tools.

NPS hack: Conditionally ask for feedback

After someone fills out an NPS survey, you can send them down different paths
depending on how they answer.

If their answer is between 0 and 8, ask them what it would take to make your product
better. If they fill out a 9 or 10, ask for a testimonial (or, if you’re an ecommerce brand,
an Amazon review).

Note: If you have an iOS app, you may get banned for asking for an App Store review
after a high rating. But it’s fair game on your website.

Pull Virality
Pull virality is when a product is shared because doing so increases its benefits. Users
“pull” in others to get the most out of a product.

Pull virality applies to product types like:

● Social media: You’ll have a better experience on Instagram or Snapchat if more
of your friends are on it.
● Collaboration and communication tools: There’s not much point in using
Dropbox, Slack, or Zoom if your collaborators aren’t on there too. Collaboration
tools aren’t just for work—apps like Strava (workouts) and Nextdoor (community
news) also encourage in-app interaction.
● Practical tools: For instance, if you need to get paid and the person doing the
paying uses a specific payment app, you’ll download it too.
You have a little more control over pull virality than word of mouth, since you can build it
into your product. On the other hand, it can be challenging to enable this type of virality
after a product build. Just another reason why it’s so important to understand, from early
on in your company’s life, your five fits and how to optimize your product for your growth
lanes.

Here are two ways to build pull virality into your product.

Design your product so its content is meant to be shared.
Design your product so users collaborate or have transactions with others.
Design your product so its content is meant to be shared.
Social media is the most prominent platform type for user-generated content (UGC)
that’s meant to be shared. No one would use LinkedIn, Facebook, etc., if they didn’t

have connections there.

If content sharing is central to your core product value, make it a) easy to make content,
and b) easy to share content.

Besides social media, here are some other examples of products with content-sharing
pull virality:

● RedPen lets you leave comments on design mockups. In order to leave feedback
on a design, you have to use RedPen.
● Spotify users can create playlists of their favorite songs, then share them with
friends or anyone else who might be interested.
● GoPro users often share their camera footage with their networks, inspiring
others to consider getting GoPros themselves.
● Eventbrite: To accept an invitation through an events service, you almost never
reply “yes” or “no” to the invitation email. Instead, you have to register through
the platform.
For a deeper dive on viral and user-generated content, visit our Content Marketing
modules, where we discuss tactics for making editorial content and UGC gain traction.

Design your product so users collaborate or have
transactions with others.
When users need to work with non-users during natural use of the product, those
non-users can become your next conversions.

Collaborative or transactional pull virality is particularly powerful for B2B companies with
a “land and expand” strategy. You land by getting one person to use your product, and
then you expand when they invite the rest of their team.

Here are a few B2B examples of collaborating and transacting:

● Bid Ops: You know how Costco has super cheap prices because you buy in
bulk? Bid Ops lets companies and local governments band together to buy at
super steep discounts.
● Poshmark connects people interested in buying and selling clothes, shoes, and
accessories. Sellers need accounts to create listings, and anyone who wants to
make a purchase must also create an account.
● GitHub: If you want to make changes to a team’s codebase, you need a GitHub
account.
Pull virality main takeaway s
The most important takeaway on pull virality is don’t force it. The referral should
enhance—not detract from—the value users get from your product.

Another important takeaway is to always think about the benefits to both the inviter and
the invitee. Two common ones are:

● Entertainment: e.g., the existing user just watched a hilarious video they know
their friend would love too.
● Ease: e.g., the existing user’s workload would get lighter if their colleague signed
up for the same app. And the non-user might discover a workload-management
system they like too.
Both sides have to have something to gain. Something they can’t get without extending
or accepting that invitation.

Push Virality
The third type of organic virality is push virality. This is similar to word of mouth, except
that instead of hearing people talk about a product, you see it. Exposure leads to
awareness, which could lead to interest and conversion.

“Push” is actually too active of a verb for what’s happening. The person doing the
exposing doesn’t have to do anything other than use the product naturally. It’s a passive
type of virality—and therefore an effortless, friction-free one.

Here are some examples:

● Physical products: A cool person wears Supreme → you see them on the street
→ you think Supreme is cool and decide to buy it. AirPods are another example.
● Digital products: When you buy something online and see that the checkout
process is “powered by Stripe,” you’re exposed to Stripe. And you’ll recognize it
the next time you see it.
● Vehicles: You see someone riding an electric bike / Tesla / Uber (in Uber’s early
days) → you register it and store it in your memory for later retrieval.
In addition to being similar to word of mouth, push virality has a close relationship with
WoM. When someone sees a product in the wild and gets interested in it, they often talk
about it too. In Uber’s early days, riders were talking about how great their product was.

Familiarity breeds preference
Push virality works because when we see something more, we tend to like it more.

According to the mere-exposure effect, people develop a preference for things because
they’re familiar with them. If you’ve heard of A and never heard of B, you’ll probably like
A more. That effect is at the root of marketing strategies like influencer marketing,
guerilla marketing, traditional advertising (e.g., billboards), and really all standard ad
campaigns—hence “impressions” as a metric.

Of course, the more market share your product has, the more exposure it will get. All
your growth tactics will help with that. Here are a few product features that can also help
increase push virality.

Digital product features
Some features that can increase exposure for digital products are:

● Signatures and “credit lines.” Let users or recipients know who’s behind the
curtain. Examples: “Powered by Slice,” “Proudly created with Wix.” This kind of
language often appears at the bottom of emails sent through email service
providers like Mailchimp, Intercom, and Superhuman.
● Buttons and widgets. To order a pizza from your local pizzeria, you might click
a button that says “Order online with DoorDash.”
● URLs. This is much subtler, but you could put your company name in URLs. For
example, when a company sends out a survey managed by the survey brand
Alchemer, “Alchemer” appears in the URL for that survey.
A simple tactic that pretty much all B2B companies can use: Try increasing exposure
through clients’ and partners’ websites. For instance, look into getting your logo added
to their partners page. This can be mutually beneficial. If your brand sends its logo, you
get more visibility. If your brand is reputable, your partner benefits from showcasing their
relationship with you.

Physical product features
Physical products have inherent push virality, which can be amplified when you draw
attention to your brand. Add your branding to your packaging. Give out free stickers of
your logo. Anytime someone puts one on their water bottle, they’re showcasing your
brand.

But people will only do that if they like your brand and product. Push virality starts with
creating a product people want to push, and it continues with knowing who those people
are. Yet another reason why brand-market fit and customer research are vital.

Example: Electric scooters and Segway
Two similar products had very different virality paths.

The launch of Segway in 2001 was centered on word-of-mouth virality : getting people
to talk about the product as a way to build anticipation. Everyone was talking and writing
about the incredible invention that would be coming to market soon. It would be
“revolutionary,” Jeff Bezos said. “As significant as the personal computer,” Steve Jobs
said.

The problem was that no one actually knew what the product was. They just knew who
the inventor was (the millionaire Dean Kamen) and that Harvard Business School Press
had already acquired a book about it for a quarter million dollars. The Harvard editors
didn’t even know what the product was.

That could have all been great. Except that when the product actually debuted, the
response was a collective huh? It wasn’t a game changer. It was a mall cop transporter.
The Segway flopped. Hard.

Compare that to electric scooters. Those emerged on the market more gradually.
City-dwellers started using them to get around, with urban centers like San Francisco
and San Antonio acquiring thousands of them to improve sustainable transportation
options.

As more people used electric scooters along city streets, they gained visibility through
push virality. They demonstrated their usefulness in action. Global revenue for the
electric scooter market grew 9.8% from 2020 to 2021, with sales expected to triple
between 2021 and 2031.

The takeaway: Push virality works—but only if your product has core value and solid
market fit.

Electric scooters offer a clear value—they’re an easy, affordable way to get
around—and they fit in a market that cares about reducing emissions. At Segway, on
the other hand, the marketing team couldn’t validate product-market fit because they
couldn’t tell anyone what the product was!

In fact, core product value and product-market fit are essential for all virality types. If
users don’t love your product, they won’t pull others into it. They won’t talk about it. And
they won’t recommend it to their friends no matter the incentive (unless they don’t really
like those friends).

Everything goes back to your product. And the value users get from it.

Incentivized Virality
This is probably what you default to thinking about when you think “referrals.” With
incentivized virality, users get a reward when they invite others to join your product.

The goal of incentivized virality is to get quality leads from users who already love your
product. It can turn your best customers into a profitable, self-running sales team.

Some well-known examples of incentivized virality are:

● Dropbox: get free storage space for you and the person you invite
● Uber: refer a new user, get free credits
● Outdoor Voices: give $20 to get $20
What incentives should you offer?
The most common way to implement incentivized referrals is through dual-ended
rewards: The referrer gets cash back, and the person being referred gets a discount on
their first purchase.

This has been modestly successful for many companies. But it's a small channel for
user acquisition. Most people don't care about earning a small amount of cash. They
didn't start using your app to make a few bucks.

Instead, here's how you should think about incentives...

Focus on value over cash
The best referral programs dole out value that's aligned with their product's key value
prop. Instead of giving out cash, they give you more access to the product.

For example, when the fitness tracker Whoop sends users new hardware, it offers a
great value-based incentive:

● The user gets a month free if they give their old device to a friend, and that friend
then becomes a member.
● Their friend gets a free fitness device, plus two months free.
And as a third benefit, Whoop solves the problem of what to do with your old equipment
in a way that’s not just friendly—it’s also eco-friendly.

Many ecommerce businesses award points that can be redeemed for exclusive
discounts and promotions. Referring a friend to online consignment shop thredUP, for
instance, gets you store credit.

If you don't have a product that can be doled out in units (e.g., GBs, videos hosted,
postcards sent), and if it wouldn’t make sense for your brand to offer credits/points, your
cash bonus needs to be significant to motivate people.

● If you have a subscription service, offer the service for free for months.
● If you're ecommerce, offer the product for free once a customer has referred a
certain number of people.
When to push referrals
The best time to ask for an incentivized referral is after the user's magic moment. That’s
when they feel the strongest connection to your product and the benefits it gives them.

Two common magic moments are when users:

Just experienced the value of your product for the first time. They’ve just
solved a problem or experienced joy because of your product. Whatever it is your
product does for them, they see those benefits clearly. The marketing claims are
true.
Just experienced more value from your product. They’ve just discovered that
they can also do X with your product. This pleasant surprise will leave people
delighted—and in the mood to refer your product.
Whatever you do, don’t ask for a referral at the end of the sales process, before
someone has even tried the product. That’s like asking someone if they’d recommend a
movie as they’re waiting in line to go watch it.

How to push referrals
Send an email to someone who’s just hit their magic moment. We usually recommend
this as a first step for clients because it’s so quick to set up and test on a small group of
customers. Here’s a template you can use.

Also feature your referral program on your website. A lot of companies make the
mistake of tucking their referral page into a corner of their app, off a settings page that
requires multiple clicks to get to. Instead, use a modal, banner, above-the-fold slider,
or thank-you page to highlight your referral program. Provide a clear option to close
the modal, banner, etc., so the user experience can continue uninterrupted.

Pop Chart features its referral program in its above-the-fold homepage slider. But it's only visible on
one slide, so this approach strikes a good balance between being prominent and not too in your
face.
Viral Loops and Kickoff Labs build referral pages and affiliate link programs in seconds.

Tip: Don’t forget about the onboarding experience.

The first-time user experience is critical. That applies to newly referred users too. Don't
have them land on a signup page that immediately instructs them to claim their referral
incentive. First, they should be pitched on what your product is and why it’s worth
getting excited about.

That means you might have to make an intermediate landing page for people who are
getting referred. It should look similar to your homepage. Since you know the audience
so well, you can handle their exact concerns based on where they’re coming from.

Here are some examples.

Tim Ferriss: Let’s say you listen to a Tim Ferriss podcast episode about a new
swimming technique. Here’s the affiliate landing page you’d arrive at before you could
enroll in the program.

Stitch Fix: If a friend shares their referral link for Stitch Fix's personal styling service,
here's the landing page you'd arrive at.

Besides detailing the referral offer, this page has a section that explains exactly how the
service works.

Otter: If a friend shares their referral link for Otter.ai's audio transcription service, you
would encounter this landing page.

It says what you'll get from Otter's service ("rich notes for meetings...") and also offers
social proof (awards) to convince you to join.

The Referral → Outreach Loop
A surprising thing about referrals is that they often lead to interesting partnerships and
cold outreach strategies.

Here's a set of steps we've followed. These have led to hundreds of thousands in
revenue in less than two months—for many companies we've worked with. Think about
them as you craft your own referral strategy.

Find your happiest users.
Figure out what groups they belong to. This could be anything from a female
founders group to a university alumni network to a restaurant management trade
association. How do you find out? Ask them, literally. Ask what groups they
belong to.
Ask your happy users to connect you with the heads of those groups. Solve a
problem they have, even if it's not related to your business. For example, you can
refer new members to the group. You can also refer speakers, offer deals, offer
to write content for them, or provide free office hours. Down the road, these
people will inevitably send you referrals.
Reach out, cold, to similar people in those groups, referencing the original happy
users as case studies (with their permission).
Going through groups is particularly powerful because it only takes one entry point to
reach many, many people.

A growth strategy that relies on relationships and warm introductions, but reaches
thousands of people?

Sign us up. That's scalable and sound.

Other examples of outreach incentives
If you're targeting founders and find that many users come from Indie Hackers, you
could host a free office hours session and offer a special deal for Indie Hackers users.

If you're making an automation tool for lobbyists , ask your customers if they're part
of a lobbying association. You might throw a joint webinar with an organization like the
Lobbying Institute.

If you're targeting real estate developers , you might write an opinion piece in your
local newspaper explaining the hidden benefits of a recent new development, then
email that link to your local real estate development association.

If you're targeting coffee connoisseurs , consider doing a live class on brewing
techniques, with a special deal for attendees.

If you're targeting millennial and gen Z investors and find that many users come
from the personal finance subreddit, you might consider doing an AMA and offering a
special deal for Redditors.

Project: Craft a Viral Strategy
Phase 1: Setup
Make a copy of our virality spreadsheet.

Phase 2: Magic Moment
Phase 2a: Qualitative magic moment

Walk through your app or checkout flow. At what point does the user feel like they’ve
gotten the greatest value out of your product?

This is when we'll ask for a referral. Write it down in your doc.

Sometimes it's obvious. Sometimes you have to ask users to know. We do this with user
surveys.

Phase 2b: Data-driven magic moment

Another way to find your magic moment is by looking at your data.

It’s not always possible for SaaS companies to pinpoint their magic moment. For
example, for Dollar Shave Club, the magic moment is right after someone shaves with
one of their razors for the first time and sees themselves clean-shaven in the mirror.
That can't be tracked digitally.

If your magic moment isn’t obvious, you can use a couple of proxies:

Proxy 1: Find out if people pay for your product again****.

If someone doesn't cancel their subscription and doesn't buy from your competitor,
chances are they felt your magic moment.

If someone finishes a free trial and decides to pay, that's a magic moment.

Use those kinds of pieces of evidence to zoom in on your magic moment.

Proxy 2: Cohort analysis.

A cohort analysis is a month-by-month breakdown of how many people stay with your
app. It usually lives in your analytics tool (e.g., Mixpanel, Heap, Amplitude).

For example, say you see in your analytics tool that 40% of your users leave after a
month, and another 30% leave after the second month. But 90% of users who make it
to the third month stay at least a year.

The third month is the point at which most users stick around. You can usually see this
graphically, without having to do any math. It's where the curve starts to flatten out.

Here’s a real example from Heap.

The retention point is clearly at one week. In fact, we’d even want to break it down by
day at that point.

Can you find a retention point for your product? If you can, write it down. That's where
you'll want to ask for a referral.

Phase 3: Word-of-mouth virality
Go through our word-of-mouth reading. Brainstorm three ideas that could apply to your
product.

Add them to the word-of-mouth section of the template.

Phase 4: Pull virality
Go through our pull virality reading. See if it applies to your product. Remember, pull
virality only works for certain types of products, and it's not something you want to force.

If pull virality is relevant to your product, add three ideas to the pull virality section of the
template.

Phase 5: Push virality
Go through our push virality reading. Brainstorm a list of three ideas that could help
increase exposure to your product. Add them to the push virality section of the template.

Phase 6: Incentivized virality
Phase 6a: Incentives

Go through our incentivized virality reading. Write down two or three incentives that you
think would work for your product.

Remember to focus on value over cash.

Phase 6b: Ideas

Brainstorm three ideas for referral programs and incentivized virality. Add them to the
incentivized virality section of the worksheet.

Think about what an incentive program would look like if it involved a real human being
or a personalized touch—not just a templated email with a spammy-looking link.

Phase 7: Explore Viral Loops (optional)
Go to Viral Loops and sign up for a free trial. Follow their onboarding process, and poke
around to see if any of their templates would apply to you.

Get comfortable with the UI. Walk through it and set up as much as you can. You don’t
have to go live with it—just get used to what all the fields are and what everything
means.

Phase 8: Prioritize
Go through each of your ideas. Rank them by three criteria: cost, time, and appeal. Use
the second tab in this spreadsheet.

● Cost. How expensive it would be to implement. Try to get to a dollar amount.
Take the salaries of the employees you'd need, figure out how much they cost
per hour, and multiply that by the number of hours it would take. Add in the cost
of any tools for the length of time you'd need to use them to test your referral
program. (If this doesn't make sense, there's an example coming below. Hold
tight and read on.)
● Time. How long it would take to get started.
● Appeal. How compelling the idea is on a scale of 1 to 10. Some ideas are just
a lot sparklier than others.
See if anything floats to the top based on those criteria.

Example

Let's say you want to add a referral page to your app, with a link people can share with
friends. You'll need to make the page using Viral Loops, plus your devs will have to hook
in your API and set up your site to point at Viral Loops’ page at the right time. You'll want
to test it for the length of your usual sales cycle and pull the plug if it's not profitable.

1) Cost

Dev cost per hour: $100

Dev hours: four

Total dev cost: $400

Viral Loops test length: two months (if that’s the length of your sales cycle)

Viral Loops price: $70/month

Viral Loops cost: $140

Total cost: $540

2) Time to push live (including QA and getting blocked): two weeks

Add a buffer of 1.5x for bugs, testing, and management.

3) Appeal

Pretty straightforward. Five out of 10.

Phase 9: Bulletproof it
Think through all the different possible outcomes of your referral program to make sure
your strategy is bulletproof. Here are two examples of how it can all go wrong.

Upstart

Upstart is a site that offers people personal loans. For a short while, if you referred a
friend, you and your friend would each get $150 in cash once they took out a $1,000
loan.

What happened?

People referred friends, who took out $1,000 loans. Both friends immediately claimed
the referral bonus.

Then, the friend would immediately repay the loan. Without interest. This meant that
Upstart made no money on the new loan. In fact, they would lose $300 ($150 for each
friend).

There are hackers who spend their time trolling the internet and spreading these
programs throughout their network. Don’t let them feast on you.

Vietnamese rats

When the French ruled Vietnam, there was a rat infestation in Hanoi. Rats everywhere.
Not good.

The government came up with a bounty program that paid people a reward for each rat
they killed. To claim the bounty, people would have to show a severed rat tail to prove
they had killed a rat.

Suddenly, officials started seeing rats running around with no tails. It turned out that
people were catching rats, cutting off their tails, and then releasing them back into the
sewers. So the rats could make more rat babies. And people could cut off more rat tails.

Instead of improving the situation, authorities had made the problem worse.

Lesson: Be careful what you incentivize.

Run through your top ideas and make sure they can’t be easily gamed.

Phase 10: Go live
Make it happen. See how many referrals you get. Set a reminder to check if they justify
the ongoing monthly costs.

Project: How to Read Ad Results and
Optimize Ads
Your ads have been set up. The sun is shining. Potential customers are singing. You
can feel the beauty of a low CAC (Cost of Acquiring a Customer) about to grace your
future.

But you’re not quite done.

In fact, the most important part of your growth journey is yet to come.

See, without exception, it is always the case that you need to optimize your ads after
you set them up. It can be the difference between running ads profitably and
unprofitably. And no matter what, it’s going to make your ads a hell of a lot cheaper to
run.

What is ad optimization?
Ad optimization, fundamentally, means turning off old ads and ad sets, creating new ads
and ad sets, and changing the rest of your funnel to make it cheaper to get new
customers. Based on the data you get.

The goal is to find the combination of copy, creative, placement, audience, timing,
platform, and more that leads to the lowest CAC.

For example: you may find that women between the ages of 30 and 45 click through
your ads twice as much as anyone else. Except in New York and California. With that
knowledge, you might:

A) Restrict your ad set targeting just to those women.

B) Exclude New York and California from your ad set.

C) Redesign and rewrite your landing page for a female audience.

D) Show pictures of women in the midwest, instead of generic pictures of the coast, on
your landing page.

Another example: you may find that your video ads are four times cheaper (in Cost per
Purchase) than the other types of ads you’re trying. With that knowledge, you might:

A) Turn off all the non-video ads

B) Make new video ads that hit different value props

C) Make new video ads with a different “feel” like an animated ad, if you’ve only used
live people in your videos.

High level overview
We’re going to use Facebook as our main example for this project, mainly because it
shows you many options and data to optimize. But this advice applies all ad channels
(Pinterest, Snapchat, Quora, etc.)

Phase 0: Set reminders
As soon as you’ve launched your ads, you should be setting reminders for yourself to
optimize ads in 1 day, 4 days, 7 days, 14 days, 17 days, and 21 days. (And every week
afterwards.)

We’ll dive into each of these intervals in depth in the following phases.

If you’re running Facebook ads, make sure you’ve set up your metrics correctly (see
Facebook and Instagram > Project: Setting up Facebook Metrics).

1 day

This is where you make sure that nothing egregious has gone wrong (like forgetting to
turn on an ad set or mistyping a budget).

4 days

Look at initial results and cut out obviously low performing ads and adsets.

7 days

Heavier optimization.

14, 17, 21 days, and every week after that.

Continuing optimization.

Check back to see if results have changed significantly, especially if your product has a
longer sales cycle (it takes longer for people to buy).

Phase 1: 1 day check
This is a fairly quick run through. Run through this checklist:

● Are the ads running at all?
● Is spend crazy high? Check the “Amount Spent” column. Make sure it’s in line
with what you budgeted.
● Are CPCs (cost per click) crazy high?
○ Check the “Cost per Unique Outbound Click” column.
○ Multiply your CPCs by 10.
■ (Assumption: 1 out of every 10 people who click your ad actually
buy. Use your real conversion rates from your site if you have
those)
○ If that’s more than 3 times your CAC, you can turn off the ad set.
■ Why? It’s going to be too expensive to acquire customers and too
much work to optimize. But first check to make sure nothing is
wrong.
○ Check your click-through rate (Unique Outbound CTR on Facebook): If it’s
under 0.5%, your ad is performing abnormally poorly. There’s either a
problem with your audience or your ad.
● Is there one ad set that’s performing so much worse than the others that it’s
worth saving yourself the money?
○ This is very very rarely the case early on. Do not just judge this based on
CPCs — we’ve had a number of clients where the CPC is higher for a few
audience that are actually cheaper per purchase.
○ Keep your eyes on the prize: the purchase. Don’t think too much about the
intermediate metrics like clicks or signups.
● If, for some reason, there’s an ad set running that has no purchases and you’ve
already spent 3 times your acceptable CAC, you can turn it off for now.
You’ll want to revisit it later (21 days later, and possibly sooner) to see whether it took
time for those leads to convert (meaning, actually buy).

Phase 2: Initial optimization – 4 day check
And now, the meat of the work. Here’s a checklist you can use as you follow along.

Phase 2a: Open dashboard
Head to your ad dashboard.

Make sure you can see every live combination of ad sets on the dashboard. (These are
called “Campaigns” on Twitter and LinkedIn. Wherever you set your audience and group
your ads is what matters).

Phase 2b: Set your date range
Do “Lifetime” if possible. Include today’s date in the data. This is a common gotcha —
we’ve drawn many wrong conclusions because the date range is gone. This happens
frequently.

Bookmark this page with the Lifetime date range as your default starting page whenever
you visit the channel. For example, whenever you want to visit Ads Manager on
Facebook, use the bookmark you made that uses the Lifetime date range to start
(unless you’re trying to look at specific data).

If you’re on Twitter, make sure you include today’s date in the data (otherwise Twitter
only looks at the day before). Selecting “This Year” is a good way to do this (unless it’s
January 1st or early in the year).

Phase 2c: Sort by your Holy Grail Metric or amount spent
Watch this video.

Ideally, your Holy Grail Metric should be whatever you record when a customer makes a
purchase. Or, if there’s not enough data on it, it should be as downfunnel as possible.

In the example below, our Holy Grail Metric is “Cost per Web Content View”. Sort by
“Descending”.

You may not be able to sort by your Holy Grail, depending on your ad channel. There’s
a chance you’ll have to look at Google Analytics or Mixpanel/Heap Analytics/etc. to see
how you’re actually doing downfunnel.

This is why UTM tags are so important — they let you keep track of which ads and ad
sets are converting well, even after your ad channel (e.g., LinkedIn — especially
LinkedIn) loses track.

If you don’t have many purchases yet, it’s sometimes better to sort by amount spent and
rule out ad sets where you’ve spent too much.

LinkedIn note: LinkedIn’s conversion tracking is notoriously broken. Their own reps
admit it. So even if you are tracking conversions, you can’t trust it. You’ll need to get
data from GA or your analytics tool.

Phase 2d: Figure out if you have enough data to do
anything
Watch this video.

Run through each ad set.

Fundamentally, there are two things you need to ask before you can touch an ad set:

Does my ad set have at least 1,200 reach? Based on Demand Curve’s
experience, this is the bare minimum amount of data we’ve found we need for
initial patterns to hold up.
Do two or three marginal conversions make a difference? (Explained below.)
To optimize an ad set, the answer to #1 should be yes and the answer to #2 should be
no.

Does my ad set have at least 1,200 reach?

In the example above, notice that the top ad set is much more expensive than the
others ($17.41 vs. $1-3). You might think, “Boy, that’s an order of magnitude more
expensive. I should turn that off.”

If you’re absolutely strapped for cash, sure. Turn that puppy off.

But guess what. There ain’t much data. Only one person has done what we want, and
only 646 people have seen our ad set.

Almost always, you’ll want your ad to reach at least 1,200 people before you do
anything. There’s too much variability otherwise.

Do two or three marginal conversions make a difference?

In the example above, it only takes two more people to bring your CPA back within
range. (CPA means “Cost Per Acquisition” — an “Acquisition” is a “Website Content
View” in the example above.) Two more people brings you to three total.

$17.41 (your total amount spent) divided by 3 is $5.80. That’s pretty close to the other
ad sets. So at this point, leave the ad set on for another day or two. See if it comes back
within range of your acceptable CAC.

Here’s the rule: We care about the difference that two to three more conversions would
make.

“Marginal conversions” mean “two or three more conversions”: what would your CAC
look like with 3 or 4 conversions instead of 1?

We don’t want you to burn your money. So we’re going to act on data in the most
profitable way we can.

Don’t turn off your ad set just yet, though. First...

Phase 2e: Pause poorly performing ads
Watch this video.

Facebook will pause some ads for you automatically — other platforms likely won’t. And
Facebook doesn’t always pause the right ads.

Before you even think about turning off an ad set, you’ll want to break it down by ad.
Sometimes, one ad will drastically outperform the others, but your platform
(Facebook/Quora/etc.) is optimizing for the wrong thing.

Click into one of your ad sets. Sort by your holy grail metric. (Sometimes, sorting by
“Amount Spent” saves you more time here.)

Turn off the ads that are two to three times as expensive as the others, assuming the
marginal conversion (explained above) doesn’t make a difference.

Do this within each ad set.

Phase 2f: Break down across as many metrics as
possible
Watch this video.

Don’t turn off an ad set until you’ve ruled it out across all major demographics and
metrics.

Different platforms give you more or fewer metrics — we’re using Facebook as an
example because it has by far the most ways to break down your data.

Head back to your “Campaign View”, where you can see all your ad sets at once.

Click on “Breakdown”, then “By Delivery”. Start with “Age”

See if there are differences in performance between age ranges (if you have enough
data). Do the same thing at the ad level.

Specifically, you’ll want to look for poorly performing audiences (that have a 3x CAC or
higher) to exclude them from your targeting. Instead of only focusing on top-performing
ones. For example, by excluding New York and California from the US instead of only
targeting Kentucky, you’ll still able to serve ads to other states in the midwest and get
more data on them.

This way, you can reach more people than by restricting your targeting only to the best
audiences. And it will take longer for people to get tired of your ads.

If there are any audiences that are borderline (the CAC is 1x to 2.5x what it should be),
exclude them and target them in separate ad sets with creatives and landing pages
specifically tailored to them.

For example, if you're seeing that 55-65 year old women are responding with a 1.5x
CAC, exclude them from the original ad set. Then, make a separate ad set targeting
only 55-65 year old women, and serve them offer ads with senior discounts, pointing to
a new landing page with an older woman in the image.

Productivity Bonus - Filters

If you’re running a bunch of ad sets, the number of rows can get overwhelming and
confusing. You’ll want to cut your results down to a manageable number of rows.

Usually, this will mean looking at only one ad set. Here’s how.

Let’s say you only want to look at your retargeting ad set. Hit “Search”, then Ad Set
name:

Then, when you break down your data, you’ll only see your retargeting ad set. Much
less overwhelming.

Another example: if you’re looking at cities, but you want to restrict to ad sets where
you’ve reached over 6,000 people total, hit “Filters”, then “Ad Set Metrics” > Reach:

Break down by other categories

You’ll want to break down by each of the categories below. We’re including examples
from how we’ve optimized for clients in the past.

These categories have historically been the largest variables for advertising
performance.

● Age
● Gender
○ This can also inform whether other ad channels are worth testing.
○ For example, if women drastically outperform men, it opens up Pinterest
as a potential channel to test (which typically performs well for women
between 22 and 45).
● Age and Gender
○ This combination is particularly important to look at. There might be an
interaction you’re missing if you only broke down by Age and Gender.
○ For example, you might discover that you perform well with moms but not
dads — when at first you thought you appealed broadly to parents.
● Country
○ We’ll often separate countries out into separate ad sets as well
● Region (this really means “State” in the United States)
○ DMA Region
○ This roughly breaks down by county.
○ In the past, for example, we’ve found high-converting counties in the past
and written specific ad creatives tailored to that county or city.
■ To do that, you’ll sometimes need to include a broad area, and then
exclude specific sub areas with a given radius. For example, in the
past, we’ve included San Francisco and Oakland, but excluded
South San Francisco to avoid the less profitable parts of SF.
○ You’ll need to wait a while to get enough data to draw conclusions here.
But if you sort by descending reach, you can sometimes exclude larger
counties that don’t perform well (with enough data).
● Impression device
○ This is where, for example, you could see that it’s way cheaper to get
customers on Android than on iOS.
● Platform
○ If you’re on a budget and had to combine Facebook and Instagram into
one ad set, this is where you’d see which one performed better.
● Platform & Device
○ Same argument as for viewing the “Age and Gender” combination.
● Placement
○ Extremely important. This is, for example, whether you perform better in
the Instagram feed or in an Instagram story.
● Placement & Device
○ Same argument as for viewing the “Platform & Device” combination.
● Time of Day (Viewer’s Time Zone)
○ If you’re a startup and strapped for time, it’s a lot of work to set up an ad
set that only runs in, say, New York during NY’s commuting hours, and
another running in Beijing during their commuting hours.
○ But putting in that extra work does make a difference.
○ The shortcut is to add a buffer for time zones that are close together and
run ads to them all at once.
Phase 2g: Make new ads
You may have already done this, but take what you’ve learned from breaking down your
data and put it into practice. Target new audiences, make new ads.

Guidelines: Making New Ads

● Make new ads tailored to the audiences that are converting best.
○ For example, if dog owners from Florida are performing particularly well,
test copy that reads “The only organic dog food in Florida that delivers
right to your door” and put it in its own ad set, targeting dog owners in
Florida.
○ This includes retargeting ads; write copy that assumes they’ve already
been to your site and are familiar with your product in general.
● Make retargeting ads specific to the products that people visit.
○ We’ve found this to be particularly successful for clients.
○ If you sell 10 different products: dog food, a dog bowl, dog chew toys, etc.,
make a different retargeting ad for each one.
Note: only duplicate ad sets when you can't change an existing ad set.

Ordinarily, you might think, "That doesn't make sense! I'd rather keep things organized
to run a cleaner test." Here's the problem: the ads in the new ad set will lose all their
engagement — likes, comments, and shares – which can drastically hurt performance.

So: it’s better to use the same ad than to make a new one.

Phase 2h: Now pause poorly performing ad sets
Watch this video.

Great. You’ve broken down by metrics and probably made some changes.

If there are any ad sets that are performing an order of magnitude worse than the
others, or have hit 3x your CAC, turn those suckers off.

Make sure to check the ad sets that you’ve spent a lot on that have no conversions.
Those can often slip through the cracks.

Phase 2i: Update your log
We like to update a Dropbox Paper doc with only the major changes and optimizations
we make. It’s particularly useful when you’re trying to look at data starting with the date
you made a major change.

For example, you might want to look at your ad set performance after you excluded
certain locations and added a new video ad.

Here’s an example we used internally for a real client.

There’s a place in the Facebook UI to see every change you’ve ever made, but it’s a
pain to use because Facebook keeps specific track of everything , down to when you
adjusted a budget. There’s a lot of noise. But you can follow the instructions to do it
here if you want.

Phase 3: Initial optimization – 7 day check
Run through the steps in Phase 2 again.

Why a 7 day check? We sometimes see different behavior on the weekend compared to
during the week, so it’s ideal to wait for a whole week to finish before optimizing too
much.

You’ll also have more data to make better decisions.

More importantly, if you have a longer sales cycle (people take more time between
seeing your ad and buying it), you need to wait at least a week or more before you see
reliable results.

Phase 3a: Get a social boost
Find your highest performing ads. Check the box next to them and hit “Preview”. Then
click the little square with the arrow on the top right.

Then click “share a link”. Copy that link.

Then, send it to your happiest customers asking them to leave a genuine review of you
in a comment with a like.

Why?

The more likes and comments an ad has, the more Facebook promotes it in the
newsfeed. Which means you don’t have to bid as much to show up — making your CAC
cheaper.

Lots of likes and comments also makes your product look more trustworthy and legit. So
people will click through the ad more. And are more likely to convert.

Assuming your product is good enough to have happy customers, this is a good-hearted
hack that has worked wonders for us.

Phase 4: Continuing optimization - 14, 17,
21 day checks and beyond
You may need to run through Phase 2 again, but you may have already started
optimizing and finding ad sets that perform well, as well as cutting out the ones that
aren’t performing well. Good work.

We now do a different type of optimizing. “Continuing optimization”: keeping what works
working, and fixing (or getting rid of) what doesn’t.

You’ll want to check your ads twice a week at minimum. If ads turn out to be the primary
way you’re getting revenue, you’ll want to check daily.

Phase 4a: Check your Holy Grail Metric
As more and more people see your ads you’ll need to keep an eye on your Holy Grail
Metric (Cost per X) to make sure it doesn’t start to rise above your acceptable CAC (or
acceptable CPA).

Phase 4a.a: If your Holy Grail Metric is acceptable...
You’ve won. Congratulations. This is huge for your business. For now.

You can start to spend more and reach more people profitably. But, if you spend too
much, you’ll “blow out” your ad set and people will get “fatigued”, meaning they’ll see
your ads too often.

On most platforms, you can get a sense of your overall reach or daily impressions by
editing the ad sets.

On Facebook, check your ad set’s overall reach by editing it and looking at the Potential
Reach on the graph on the right. Increase your daily budget until the top number (your
estimated daily reach) is 1/55th of your Potential Reach. We’ve found that two months
(~55 days) tends to be enough time for people to move into and out of audiences.

If your potential reach is “Unavailable”...

Start removing the custom audiences you’re excluding and see if potential reach
shows up.
If it does, you’ll need to account for the size of the audiences you’re excluding.
To estimate that, go into the Audiences section of Facebook and look at the
audience size.
If you’re targeting a lookalike audience in your ad set, you can use the audience
overlap tool and see how much overlap there is between the lookalike and the
excluded audiences. Subtract that overlap out.
But if you’re targeting an interest-based audience, you can’t see the overlap. So
just look at the size of the excluded audience and subtract that out to get to the
worst case scenario.
If potential reach is still "Unavailable", increase your budget by 1 to 2 times the
amount and keep doubling it every 4-7 days. Be careful. It’s hard to know how
big your audience actually is, and you risk blowing it out.
Congrats. You can skip the rest of phase 4.

Phase 4a.b: If your Holy Grail Metric is rising or too
high...
Go through the phases below. Also run through phase 2 to see if you can improve your
audience at all.

Phase 4b: Check attribution
It can be really hard to tell how many purchases your ads are really causing. Your ad
manager only tracks people who directly see your ad and buy on your site. We found
that we weren’t tracking over $50,000 a month for some clients!

Phase 4c: Check your Frequency
Once your ads have been running for a week or two, you’ll need to keep an eye on your
Frequency: this is how many times people have seen your ad, overall. This is especially
an issue when your audience has a small overall reach: there are only so many people
you can show an ad to.

Once it rises above 3, people will start to get fatigued; they’ll gloss over your ad
because they’ve seen it before and already “get it”.

This is also why ideal audiences are “living and breathing”. For example, if you’re
targeting people who “Recently Moved” on Facebook (a real targeting option), you won’t
have to refresh your ads very often; new people move every day and enter your
audience; people who have lived somewhere for a while will drop out of your audience.
So the people you care about won’t have seen your ads before.

Exception: you can afford a much higher frequency (up to 10) for retargeting ads; you’re
not spamming people because they already know your product; you’re trying to get
them to come back by catching their attention at the right moment.

If your Frequency is high, you have four options...

● Expand your audience
● Refresh your ad creatives
● Turn off the ad set (if your Holy Grail Metric is also too high)
Phase 4d: Expand your audience
You have a few levers you can pull here. Edit your ad set.

Expand targeting

On LinkedIn, you can add new industries or job titles to targeting that you may have
forgotten before (for example).

On Quora, you can add new interests and topics that are a bit farther away from your
original ones.

Now that you’ve gotten some data on who has come to your site, you can also make
new lookalike audiences off the people who have visited, signed up, purchased, etc.

On Facebook, you can do the same. There’s also that little checkbox we ignored before
in the “Detailed Targeting” section.

You can try checking it. Checking this box makes it harder to control our experiments
between ad sets, but once you’ve been running ads for a while and have narrowed
down to your top-performing ad sets, it’s less of a risk.

Expand Placements

On Facebook, you can try adding placements in the “Audience Network”. These are
other web sites and mobile apps (for example, The Huffington Post) that use
Facebook’s targeting to show ads on their site. These tend to convert worse, which is
why we don’t have you target these sites up front, but we have seen some success. It’s
worth a shot if your ad sets are failing.

You can see a list of some other sites that are in the Audience Network here.

Also, you can try expanding to Instagram Story ads -- they can convert well -- but you'll
need to make creatives that follow that placement's format.

Expand Your Lookalikes

On Facebook and Quora, you set lookalikes as a percentage of a country's population.
If a 1% lookalike audience is performing well, try expanding to 2%, 3%, etc. to get more
volume.

Refresh Your Uploaded Audience Lists

If your lookalike audience is saturated, and the seed audience is a list of customer
emails that you uploaded a while ago, upload an updated list of customers and make a
new lookalike audience.

Note: if you're using a lookalike audience with a seed audience that automatically
updates using the pixel (for example, 30 day site visitors), you don't need to refresh the
lookalike audience. According to Facebook's support, Facebook will do that
automatically every 3 to 7 days.

Phase 4e: Refresh your ad creatives
This means making new ads with new designs and new copy, especially hitting new
value props.

If you need help coming up with those, you can run through our ad copy and ad creative
projects again. At this point (assuming you’ve gotten ads to work for you), it’s worth
hiring a designer to come up with another batch of ad creatives. Just make sure they
follow our overall guidelines.

Dynamic Ads

If you're an eCommerce company with a bunch of products, and you're running
Facebook/Instagram ads, you can try running dynamic ads. These let you upload your
product catalog and autogenerate ad copy with each product.

It's not worth doing to start, but if you're having trouble getting CAC down but are within
30% or so, it's worth looking into.

Phase 4f: Turn off the ad set
Sometimes, you just can’t make it work. The Cost of Acquiring a Customer is too high.
Your target audience is too small. It happens.

Don’t spend money on ads unprofitably. Turn them off. Try a different ad set. Or a
different channel.

Phase 4g: Update your log with your changes
Update your log doc with the major changes you made

Phase 5: Schedule recurring checks
In practice, you’ll want to look at your ad performance every 3 or 4 days. To remind
ourselves, we set recurring calendar reminders and create automatic tasks in our digital
to-do lists.

Introduction: CRO
Questions answered in this module
● How can I get more visitors to actually buy on my site?
● How do I prioritize what to change on my site first?
● How can I use data intelligently to grow?
What is CRO?
CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) improves what happens after people first
visit your website — so more people become customers.

For example, to get more people to fill out your signup form, you may add a live chat
widget so users can build trust with a real human before giving their personal
information.

Another example: you want to get more people to click on the "Buy Now" button on your
homepage. To tailor the page to them, you could automatically figure out what city
they're in, based on their IP address, and then change the pictures on your homepage
to be from that city.

Ultimately, CRO ends up looking like a prioritized to-do list. You’ll rank each change
you want to make by the estimated chance it has to increase your conversion rates (and
revenue).

Here’s roughly what it should look like:

Company story
Service was a company we worked with. They're an app that refunds you when your
flight gets delayed or canceled.

When they first started running ads, people who clicked an ad would go directly to the
app store to download the app. We saw a few people downloading the app, and far, far
fewer people actually entering their credit card.

Adding your credit card is a big leap of faith. You're giving the company a lot of power.
Service hadn't built enough trust.

Getting free money back on flights? It sounded too good to be true. We had to prove to
visitors that they could trust Service.

So they inserted a landing page in between the ad and the App Store.

The landing page explained how Service worked. It also showcased news coverage and
celebrity testimonials.

So when people came to the page, they had already overcome the objections they had
about the product ("How does it actually work?", "Do other people trust it?", "Is this a
legit company?", etc.).

Conversion rates shot up. And people started adding their credit cards.

Conversion Fixes
Once you can narrow down where a problem is in your funnel and why it's happening,
you can start to brainstorm fixes.

Again, you need to narrow down the problem before brainstorming fixes.

With that said, we'll take a closer look at some of the most effective CRO tactics in our
playbook. This is by no means an exhaustive list. But for those just beginning to
optimize their funnels, this is a good starting point.

Tried-and-true CRO tactics
● Write tailored landing pages
● Add live chat to your landing page
● Shorten, remove, or reorder forms
● Add a drip email campaign
● Build trust with testimonials, reviews, or press
● Deliver the value sooner
● Target a different audience
● Gate content by asking for an email
Write tailored landing pages
Solves: poor conversion rates on landing pages.

If you're running one set of ads that target millennial moms and another set of ads that
target exercise junkies, point the mom ads at a landing page built for moms.

Use photos of millennial moms and write copy that would resonate with them.

Point the exercise junkie ads at landing pages built just for them.

At Bell Curve, for Google Ads, we'll often make pages that are targeted directly to the
keywords that someone searched on Google—pitching directly to them and their
problem.

These approaches can boost conversion rates up to about 30%.

Add live chat to your landing page
Solves: poor conversion rates on landing pages.

Site visitors often have questions that you can't answer on your landing page. So they'll
bounce. Even if the answer lives elsewhere on your site.

Use a live chat to keep them around.

Live chat tools

● Intercom
● Olark
● Zopim
● Drift
○ Drift is nice for companies with a sales team; you can set it up to
prequalify leads with a chatbot, then schedule calls directly in chat.
We usually go with Intercom. But they're all good, and features vary depending on your
budget.

Shorten, remove, or reorder forms
Solves: poor conversion rates for signup pages. Particularly for enterprise
leads.

Compare these two forms.

Here's Form A.

And here's Form B.

Form B should convert better by a long shot.

Long forms are daunting. People don't finish them. Remove fields you don't absolutely
need. Prime culprits are company names and first and last names.

Don’t ask for usernames and email addresses. Use email addresses as the username.
You don’t even have to require a password; throw someone into the product first so they
can see the value of your product, then ask them to set a password (or email them later
to set it).

Big win: ask for email addresses at the end.

Ask for a lead's email address only after asking your first qualifying questions in a form_._

For example, if you're a wedding planner marketplace and people have to fill out a form
to get matched, ask for their theme, location, budget, etc. first before asking for their
email address.

This shows leads that you really understand their problems, and they get more invested
the more they fill out the form. They won't want to throw away all the work they did, so
they'll give you their email.

This advice works particularly well in Typeforms - and it applies to both B2B and B2C.

"But what if I need data, like company size, to figure out if I should spend more time on
a lead?"

You can use a service like Clearbit or LiveRamp to fill in those blanks. Or you can ask
users for it later in your funnel — when they fully understand the value of what you’re
selling.

You want to remove the number of steps to getting their email.

Once you have the email, you can reach out to them again and again. Either directly or
through drip emails (explained next).

Otherwise, you have to rely on someone coming back to your webpage on their own.
They may never find you again.

Add a drip email campaign
Solves: poor conversion rates after people sign up

Drip campaigns are those emails you get every couple days after you sign up for a
website. Most companies do them wrong; they send out a generic email that looks
super salesy, pleading with you to come back.

Here's a bad one.

The key to good drip emails is to make it look as natural as possible, tailored to the
person receiving the email based on what you know about them.

Do as much work for them as you can — to make it easy to move to the next step.

Also, use plain text. Not company branding. It performs better. Plain text emails
looks like they’re coming from people they know—not a company trying to get them to
buy something.

If your average LTV is high enough, you should be having actual salespeople sending
your drip emails, customized to each person who has submitted their email.

For the UpWork example above, a better email would have read like this:

You can measure how well your drip campaign works by looking at open rates,
clickthrough rates, and conversion rates from emails.

Hack: you can use Clearbit Reveal to figure out who's visiting your site, look up their
email (also using Clearbit), and send them a "cold email" -- with the knowledge that they
already know who you are.

Build trust
Solves: landing page conversion rates, poor conversion rates for short
funnels.

Trust can take the form of logos of your high-profile customers, content that
demonstrates your knowledge of a topic, customer testimonials, and more.

Sometimes it means adding an extra page to your funnel to educate your site visitors.
Adding a step to your funnel is counterintuitive. Usually, you want to shorten your
funnel, not lengthen it.

But it can be worth doing if your product if it’s complex or expensive.

Deliver the value that people expect.
Sooner.
Solves: poor top-of-funnel conversion rates.

Imagine you clicked an ad that says "Find anyone's email. For free." And you end up at
a page that looks like this.

It's pretty close to what you expect — but you can't actually find anyone's email yet. You
have to create a free account, fill out your information, and jump through a couple hoops
first.

Now, imagine you clicked the same ad and ended up at this page:

Bam. You instantly search for emails, right on the landing page. Without friction.

Way better.

Get to the meat of your product as quickly as possible.

Use that to entice the user to actually add information and sign up.

Target a different audience
Solves: poor landing page conversion rates.

At Demand Curve, we usually test a few different audiences at once (recruiters,
salespeople, etc.), and use UTM tags to track who performs best.

Here's what it looks like in Google Analytics. GA lets us compare success between
different target markets really easily.

(Names and numbers changed — this is not a real client.)

You'll see audiences that are super cheap to get to your site; it doesn't cost much to get
them to click on an ad.

But sometimes they won't actually buy your product. And that's ultimately what matters.

Stop marketing to the poor performing audiences, and start marketing to the
better performing audiences.

You might have to brainstorm new audiences to do this.

Make a mobile "gate page"
Solves: poor landing page conversion rates on mobile

Some products aren't built for mobile users — and it would be enormously expensive to
make them mobile-friendly. Who's going to use a site that looks like this?

Here's a hack: just make the landing page mobile-friendly, and ask for an email.

Then, later, hit them with an email to catch them when they can actually use the site. On
a real computer.

How To Read Google Analytics
Overview
Google Analytics is useful for getting data on what pages people visit on your site,
where they came from, when people leave your site, and much more.

GA lets you break down who visited your site by what type of device they're using, what
city they're in, what website they came from, etc.

You’re going to learn enough to be dangerous.

Getting Data
Let’s assume you’re trying to find everyone who visited your homepage who isn’t yet a
customer of yours.

Go to Behavior → Site Content → All Pages. Then find the page you're trying to get
data for. Make sure you look for 'unique pageviews' and not just 'pageviews.'

For example, if you want to see how many people visited your home page...

As you find the numbers you want, you’ll probably want to exclude people who aren't
first time users. You'll have to use some intuition here.

For example, people who come to your home page might be coming to click the "login"
button — because they've already signed up for your site. They’ve already converted;
you don’t need to focus on getting them to buy your product, since they already have.

You don't care about these people for your funnel. So you'd subtract out the people who
came to your home page and then visited /login as the second page.

Here's how. Try both of these ways.

The Hacky Way (Quick and Dirty)
Add "Second Page" as a secondary dimension.
Click "Advanced"
Include traffic only for your landing page. Exclude traffic that had /login as the
second page.
Click "Apply".
Now, you should be able to see a clearer picture of all the people who came to your site
for the first time.

But this feels kind of messy, doesn’t it?

A Better Way
Make a custom report that only looks at "New Users".

Be careful here. Google isn't perfect at distinguishing first-time visitors. It determines
whether someone is a new user based on some technical criteria.

You should gut-check your funnel using both methods. The Custom Report will let you
break down your traffic multiple ways at once: for example, only showing users who
went from your homepage to your pricing page AND seeing whether they were on
mobile or desktop.

Distinguishing Mobile from Desktop Data
If you want to to break down your traffic like this:

Look for something that looks like this:

Or, in a custom report, this:

Project: CRO
What you’re working towards
We’re going to end up with a spreadsheet that looks roughly like this.

The goal here is to illuminate the most important thing to work on that will lead to the
most profit in a reasonable amount of time.

Overview
At a high level, we’re going to:

Get data on the major steps of your funnel
Figure out which steps of your funnel drop off most
Systematically deduce why people dropped off at those points
Brainstorm fixes
Prioritize what to fix first
Let’s get started.

Phase 1: Walk through your funnel
How do we know what to work on? We need to know how to fill out Column A of that
spreadsheet, to start.

First, make a copy of this spreadsheet.

Scroll right. You should see a section that looks like this.

Go to your website and pretend to be a customer, listing out every major click you make
and page you visit.

At minimum, you have to include what mechanically has to happen to get to a
purchase.

For example, you can’t purchase without adding credit card information. You can get to
the credit card screen before entering shipping info. You have to add to cart before you
check out. And so on.

For each step, add it to the spreadsheet. Your list should end up looking like this.

Sometimes, there are tons of different paths a user could take to buy your product. For
example, they may click different pricing plans and see different pages afterwards.

These are "forks" — like a fork in the road where people continue down different paths.

Make separate spreadsheets, group steps together, or ignore these forks altogether if
they converge to the same next step. We can look at them later if we find a big drop-off
after a fork and want to drill down.

Phase 2: Fill in the data
Next, you need to see how many people actually got to each step. Fill in the
spreadsheet with how many unique people got to each step.

Output
You’ll want to end up with something that looks like this. Make sure you pull data over
periods that last at least two weeks. You don’t have to pick a specific month like below.

How?
Most likely, you’re going to find these numbers in GA (Google Analytics). Now’s a good
time to make sure you’ve done our reading on it.

They may also live a few other places:

● Your analytics tool: Mixpanel, Heap Analytics, Amplitude, etc.
● Your backend (the thing the engineers work on)
● The place you get paid: PayPal, Stripe, the physical checks in your file cabinet,
etc.
Sometimes, you’re not tracking these steps in the first place. In this case, the best next
step is to add a task for your engineering team to start tracking them.

Phase 3: Figure out which parts of your
funnel drop off most
Look at the spreadsheet you made.

Focus on the % rows and find the ones with smallest percentages (meaning the biggest
drop-offs). Find significant drop-offs between time periods as well — we’ll explain what
these are below.

Color all these drop - offs red.

Here's an example.

Row 3 has a large drop-off between periods. Rows 9, 13, and 15 have a large drop-off
relative to the rest of the funnel. These are the first places you should look to fix.

You can also compare to industry standards. One common example: if you’re a SaaS
app and you have a free trial, and you ask for a credit card up front, you should expect
about 40% of people who add their credit cards to convert. If you don’t ask for a credit
card up front, you should expect about 1% of people who start the trial to convert.

Why look for the biggest drop-offs? That's where you can make the biggest impact.

Here's an example.

Let's say that 1000 people visit your signup page, but only 100 actually click "Sign Up".
You could maybe get 20 more people to sign up with some smart tweaks.

That's a 20% improvement (120 people). Plus you still have 880 people left to catch.

Now say that 1000 people visit your signup page and 990 of them sign up.

There's no way to get 20 more people to sign up! You'd be at 1010 people. So even if
you made some changes, you'd barely be able to get more people to sign up.

Conclusion?

Look for where there's more dropoff. You'll be able to make a bigger dent.

Make a list of the top steps in your funnel that people are dropping out.

Phase 4: Systematically deduce why
people dropped off
Once you've found the places your visitors are dropping out the most, figure out why
they're dropping out.

Marketing teams tend to explain drop-off the way they know know: they think they need
to market a product better to explain why people aren't converting. But, usually they
need to debug.

Very few teams know to debug first. Even fewer know how to do it well.

Here are the steps you should take to try to figure out why visitors drop out. In order of
priority.

Make sure the data is accurate
Walk through the site
Check for mobile issues
Look for anomalies
Spy on real users
Check your gut
Segment By Source
Run User Surveys
Look for feature releases
Traffic source (custom landing pages that match keywords)
1. Make sure the data is accurate
Make sure that you're actually tracking what you think. This is something you can
usually test. Quickly.

For example, Google Analytics has a "Real-Time" tab where you can see it register
pageviews and events as they happen.

On your site, click a button that you're tracking. Or visit a page you care about. Then
quickly tab over to GA and make sure that you can see it show up.

Make sure it doesn't show up twice.

Google Tag Assistant can help you find bugs as well.

For example, if you’re sending people emails, make sure you're tracking the links in
them correctly (we’ve seen our clients screw this up). Look at the number of links
people click in MailChimp (or whatever tool you’re using), and compare that to the
number of pageviews you see in GA from the same emails.

If you have a mobile app, double-check the traffic that goes to the app store page and
compare it to the number of clicks you see on the app store button on your homepage.

Clients of ours have wasted hours analyzing data, only to realize they were gathering it
wrong.

2. Walk through the site
Pretend you're someone who really needs to buy your product. Use Google Analytics
data to figure out the most common type of person who visits your site.

You're going to have some blind spots because you look at your site so often. Change
your environment so you experience the site in a different way than you normally do.

Borrow a friend's phone, use a different computer, use a different browser. This forces
you to slow down and mentally process the site more.

Chrome extensions can conflict with other chrome extensions. Teams develop their
sites on a giant monitor, but their real users use iPads. Links point to the wrong URL.

It happens. There are many ways it can go wrong.

● Click every link, button, and image
● Visit every page
● Visit on multiple screen sizes, browsers, and devices
3. See if it's a mobile issue
Go into Google Analytics or your analytics tool — wherever the original data lives for the
part of the funnel you're looking at.

Break down the data by whether the device is mobile or not. Then see if there's a
significant change in conversion rates.

This is the second most frequent issue we see.

4. Look for anomalies
Look at graphs of your data. Try to find anything that breaks the usual pattern or
looks weird.

For example, we were looking at the funnel data for one of our clients and saw that
conversion rates had plummeted compared to the previous month. This rang alarm
bells.

When we dug into the data, we noticed something strange. There was a huge spike at
one specific step of the funnel on November 7th.

When we subtracted that out, conversion rates looked normal.

We still have no idea what it was — we thought it might be a bunch of bots. But we
could be confident that potential customers weren't affected. There didn't seem to be a
real issue.

5. Spy on real users
Install a tool like Hotjar or FullStory. These let you view recordings of real users as they
use your site.

You want to watch the users who get to the page you care about, then drop out. See
where their mouse goes.

See if their screen looks any different. Look at their age and job — do some googling
and use LinkedIn to find that info.

See if you can find anything that would lead them to use the site differently than you do
— that would make them get stuck.

Make sure you watch their whole session. (You can do it at double-speed to save time.)
There can often be mismatches between what they see at the beginning and the end of
their journey.

6. Check your gut
There's a reason we don’t put this first.

We’ve seen too many cases where people swear they know what the problem is, but
there's really a more direct technical explanation.

But there is a time and a place for using your intuition. You know your users well,
potentially better than they know themselves.

So go ahead. Guess what the problem is.

Then, see if the data matches up with the story you're telling yourself.

If you think your newly redesigned homepage is hurting conversion, look at the
conversion rates before and after the page got redesigned.

Tease out conflicting explanations.

Maybe your redesign happened right after the holiday season and people were clicking
more before. Because they were shopping for presents.

Maybe they didn't care about your design at all.

7. Filter by source and medium
What do the conversion rates look like, depending on where a user came from? Did
they come from a Facebook ad? A cold email?

This secondary dimension in GA will help.

Once you figure out the sources and mediums that tend to convert better, scale up the
ones that work and cut out the ones that don’t.

8. Run user surveys
If you're looking late in the funnel (close to the purchase) and have something like
Mixpanel installed, you should be able to see the real email addresses of the users who
are getting stuck.

Email them yourself. Ask them why they didn't keep going. Expect anywhere between
15-30% reply rate.

If it's under 50 people, try to interview them on the phone.

Be honest that you're trying to make the product better and saw they were interested —
and you want their advice.

We have a separate project on surveys you can reference if you end up running with
this idea. (It's in the Conversion README.)

9. Look for feature releases
Look at the log of the recent changes you made at that section of the funnel. Your
engineering team should be able to help you out here.

Here's what happens a lot: we narrow down that a change got made (like a page getting
redesigned). We undo that change and conversion rates jump back up. But we don't
know why the redesign made things worse.

That's totally normal. Confuse correlation with causation. It will save you money to go
back to what works.

Phase 5: Brainstorm fixes
Use what you’ve deduced from the previous phases to brainstorm ideas for what to fix.
Then, look through our reading on conversion fixes and see if anything applies.

Your mindset should be, “what is fundamentally stopping people from converting?”
instead of “how do i make this page more enticing?”

Phase 6: Prioritize what to fix first
There are tons of shiny objects to start working on. How do you pick the most important
one?

There are only three things you need to consider.

Cost : How much will it cost to make this change?
Revenue : How much revenue will this change make us?
Timing : How soon can we make this change?
You can't answer these questions exactly, of course. But you can use some quick math
to get a ballpark.

Make a copy of this spreadsheet and add each of the major fixes you want to make. You
should end up with something that looks like this.

Let's break it down.

Cost
To get at the cost, take the salaries of the employees you'd need, figure out how much
they cost per hour, and multiply that by number of hours it would take.

Add in anything extra you might need, and add a buffer of 1.5x the amount of time for
bugs, testing, and management overhead.

Here are some examples:

Example 1: Make the landing page mobile-responsive

● Designer hours: 2
● Designer salary: $80,000 per year
● Cost per designer hour: $40 (80,000 / 50 weeks per year / 40 hrs per week)
● Total Designer cost: $80
● Engineer hours: 10
● Cost per engineer hour: $60
● Total engineer cost: $600
● QA hours: 1
● Cost per QA hour: $20
● Total QA cost: $20
● Total cost: $700
Example 2: A/B test removing four form fields

● Engineer hours: 2
● Cost per engineer hour: $60
● Total engineer cost: $120
● QA hours: 1
● Cost per QA hour: $20
● Total QA cost: $20
● Total cost: $140
Revenue
Estimate how many more customers you would expect from improving that step of the
funnel. Use your funnel data.

Figure out how many people aren't converting at that step, and what percentage of
those you think you could convert with that fix.

If you really have no idea what impact a change will have, a rule of thumb is a 30%
improvement (assuming you have room in the funnel to improve that much).

There can be cases where you have a good idea of how much actual revenue you'll
make. You can usually back into a number.

For example, if you have a list of 15 phone numbers of people who signed up, and you
know exactly why they're not buying, you could have the CEO call them personally after
the fix is implemented and expect to convert at least 5 of them.

Timing
Pretty self-explanatory. Estimate how long you think it will take to actually make the
change.

Profit
Roll everything up into monthly profit (revenue minus cost).

Phase 7: Get to it!
Start implementing your first change.

Introduction: A/B Tests
What you’ll learn
● How to source effective A/B ideas
● How to identify exactly what you should test on your landing page
● How to create an A/B testing strategy document for your team
Why is it important?
No landing page is perfect. No matter how hard you worked on its first iteration. Here’s
an example of a landing page we did for one of our clients:

It contains a lot of context, supporting copy, and our client’s products. Our client saw a
jump in conversion rates with this landing page. But we knew there was room for
improvement.

There always is.

We used analytics, heatmap data, and customer surveys to create an A/B variant of that
page. The only content on the new variation was the products (and thus, the page was
much shorter)

The result? Our A/B variation led to a 20% increase in conversions (and revenue) for
our client.

The only way to improve your landing page’s conversion rates is through A/B testing.
Your page might convert well now. But it can be better.

A/B testing keeps you from getting comfortable with the status quo. If you could
increase your conversion rate, even by 1%, isn’t that worth it?

Overview
A/B tests help you see what changes to your site lead to higher conversion rates (e.g.,
signup rate, checkout rate).

For example, you can rewrite the top half of your landing page. Or you can replace all
your photography with illustrations. Or you can cut your page length in half.

These are variants. (They are the "B" variants in the term"A/B.")

You test variants against your baseline , which is your landing page before you make
changes. (Your baseline is the "A" variant in the term "A/B.")

If you have a proper A/B regimen in place, it's the quickest, lowest-cost way to increase
profits. Unlike ads, A/B tests cost nothing to run, and often increase conversion by
50-300%.

There are free tools to manage all this testing logic for you. So, your only job is to figure
out what is worthwhile to test and to create the required landing page material.

Which is exactly what we discuss next.

Micro vs. Macro A/B Testing
There are two types of A/B test variants: micro and macro variants.

Micro variants
Micro variants are minor adjustments to your page's copy, creative, or layout. These are
small, quick changes. One of the most common examples is changing the color of a
CTA button, or even the copy inside that button.

These minor changes are unlikely to have a huge impact on conversions, unless you
combine several micro variants together. In which case, you’re making significant
changes to your page, which is where macro variants come in.

Macro variants
Macro variants are significant rethinkings of your page. Changing up the style
completely, the ordering of your content, or targeting an entirely new audience.

Prioritize macros over micros. That’s where you’ll see the biggest return on
investment.

Not only that, but micro variants tend to only deliver small wins (small relative to the
business outcomes you care about).

In the short-term, this may not seem important. But, in the long-term, it may introduce
unforeseen funnel consequences that can be difficult to pinpoint in hindsight.

We see it all the time.

Macro variants require considerable effort: It’s hard to repeatedly summon the focus and
company-wide collaboration needed to rethink your page.

But macros are the only way to see the forest through the trees.

Because the biggest obstacle to testing macros is committing to them, we recommend
creating an A/B testing calendar.

Create a recurring event for, say, every 2 months. On those days, spend a couple hours
brainstorming a macro variant for a pivotal page or product step.

Hack: the cheap, easy macro test
There’s one type of macro variant that doesn’t take much effort: testing a new group of
header, subheader, and image on your landing page.

This is the one type of test that can drastically change conversion — because so many
people leave a site after skimming the top of the page. With the right combination of
copy and image in your hero section, you can get them to stick around much longer.

The Importance of Big Swings
When we talk about running macro A/B tests, it's an example of a broader idea in
growth: taking big swings.

Examples
When you make a landing page that's 80% shorter than your current landing page,
that's a big swing.

Changing the color of your CTA button is NOT a big swing.

When you set up three Instagram ads — a screen recording video, an ad with only text
in the image, and an image of someone tweeting about you — those are three big
swings.

When you set up three Instagram ads — three screen recording videos with different
body text — those are NOT big swings.

If you typically email users asking for a Yelp review, and then you A/B test texting them
a meme like this asking for a review... that's a big swing.

(Maybe not one you should do. But a big swing nonetheless.)

In other words:
"Big swings" means testing things that are wildly different from each other. Then
doubling down on what works.

Why are big swings important?
When you take big swings, you win big and you lose big; the results are very different
between swings. But you get to cheat because you can only keep the ones that win -
and prune away the losers. So you improve much faster over time.

Find big winners. Quickly get rid of losers. It's evolution at work.

Project: Gather Data for Your A/B
Hypotheses
Most people conduct A/B tests wrong. Why? They create tests based on opinions they
have. Not on useful data. That’s a waste of your time and resources. Gather data before
you brainstorm ideas. You'll come up with more effective A/B variations, and a better
conversion rate.

This is the process we use at Demand Curve to A/B test all our clients’ landing pages.

Phase 0: Make Folder
For starters, create a folder in your storage platform of choice (Google, Dropbox). Name
it A/B Testing.

Create a separate document for each of the steps we outline below, and place them
inside your A/B Testing file. By the end of this lesson, you should have up to seven
documents inside your A/B testing folder, titled:

Experience-based assessment
Landing page inspiration
Competitors’ sites
On-site behavior
Sales team input
User surveys
Ad performance
You’ll record your work and findings inside each of these documents, and share them
with your team.

Note: You may not have the time or resources for all these data-gathering sources. The
first three are the easiest to gather. Gather data from these sources, at least, before any
test. Any research is better than none when conducting A/B testing.

In future tests you can dig deeper with the other data sources.

Phase 1: Experience-based assessment
Your first step is to conduct an experience-based assessment of your landing page.

Other approaches deliver more concrete data. But this type of assessment is quick and
easy to execute.

As you assess your landing page, you’ll group your findings into five main categories:

● Relevancy: Does this page deliver the experience your visitors expect?
● Clarity: Is the content on the page clear?
● Value: Does the page present the value of the product to visitors? Or is there
room for improvement?
● Friction: Are there parts of the page that cause confusion, doubts, or hesitation?
● Distraction: What elements on the page distract from the main purpose/CTA?
The most effective experience-based assessments are a team effort. Get your writers,
designers, and other key stakeholders to perform this test.

Their perspectives will give you a fuller picture of where you can improve your page.

What does this experience-based assessment look like?

● Use annotated screenshots (with tools such as CloudApp).
● Avoid adding random comments. Keep your observations focused on the five
categories listed above.
Here’s an example of an experience-based assessment of OpenPhone's landing page.

This assessment is a good start. And it's easy to perform, even if you're strapped for
time or resources.

Now it’s time to expand your research.

Phase 2: Online inspiration
Browse websites like Good Web Design. Good Web Design features dozens of landing
page designs and new approaches. Bookmark that page and revisit it whenever you’re
lost for new A/B ideas.

We recommend keeping a swipe file inside your A/B folder of ideas you want to test.

Phase 3: Competitors’ sites
Identify successful competitors in your space and mine their pages for inspiration. Do
they structure their content differently? Do they use a different tone? Take screenshots
of new ideas, and keep them in a document inside your A/B folder.

Mine their reviews. Especially on Amazon. This is a gold mine.

When Demand Curve was an agency, we performed a competitor analysis report for all
new clients. This report was an invaluable resource for future A/B testing ideas.

We had you do this at the beginning of the course. Rip from it.

Phase 4: On-site behavior
Use a visitor recording tool like Hotjar to find patterns in visitors' engagement:

● What are they clicking?
● What are they ignoring?
● What does this imply about the type of content that most appeals to them?
● How does this on-site behavior align or conflict with your own experience
assessment?
We’ll be covering this later in the course. Skip it for now and come back to it when we
work on conversion.

Phase 5: Sales team input
Team members who interact with your customers know best what appeals to them.
Have your sales team answer the questions below. And encourage them to include
screenshots of conversations and direct quotes from prospects.

● What (about the product or onboarding experience) are prospects most confused
about?
● Why do prospects say they chose not to buy the product?
● What questions are you (the sales team) asked most by prospects?
The answers to these questions will help you:

● Know the language your audience uses
● Identify key objections and address them in your landing page
● Reduce confusion by adapting your landing page copy
Phase 6: User surveys
Your sales team is an incredible source of information on what works, and what doesn’t.
But when possible, go straight to the source: your customers.

Conduct surveys (with tools like SurveyMonkey) to find out your users' favorite features
and biggest concerns.

You may also consider using on-page surveys (Hotjar offers this). These visitor surveys
can provide you specific details on where (and why) your visitors are confused or
frustrated.

But use them sparingly. They can annoy your visitors.

Gather your survey responses in a single document, and file them in your A/B folder.

We’ll be covering surveys later as well. You can skip this for now if you haven’t already
run a survey.

Phase 7: Ad performance
Your best-performing ads have value props, text, and imagery that you can repurpose
for your site. In fact, you should run ads explicitly to discover the optimal combination of
text and images.

Take screenshots of your best-performing ads, and record them in a document inside
your A/B Testing folder for future reference.

Now that you have a folder of data to work with, you’re ready to turn that data into actual
theories.

Project: Choose What to Test on Your
Page
It's time to take the data you gathered in the last lesson and transfer it to a spreadsheet.

That makes it easy to look at as a whole. Use the same five categories used in the
experience-based assessment. These are:

● Relevance
● Clarity
● Value
● Friction
● Distraction
Use any spreadsheet tool you like. Google Sheets works well. You can make real-time
comments and edits, and share it with your team.

Here’s an incomplete example of what your spreadsheet should look like. Remember,
your table may not contain all seven data sources, especially if you’re early in your
startup phase.

But any data research is better than none.

Phase 1: Make Spreadsheet
Crack open this spreadsheet in a new tab. We're also putting a screenshot below.

The first seven columns contain the data you gathered in the previous lesson. The last
column is where you come up with solutions to address the problems identified by your
data.

The bullet points you add to that column will decide what you test and how.

Phase 2: Come Up With Ideas
You might be able to come up with some ideas on your own. But here are a few
tried-and-true macro variant strategies you can use for inspiration:

Mimic sections of competitors' pages. You’ve already identified, in the table
above, parts of your competitors sites that work. Mimic some of these page
sections. By "sections," we don’t mean their words. We mean their layout tactics.
This includes charts, sliders, GIFs, and other ways of displaying information. ( Do
not rip off their site. Only take inspiration. )
Write to a new persona. Tailor your value props and copy to, say, mothers
instead of teenagers. You could have misidentified your most valuable audience.
In our table above, we recommend tailoring our copy to senior-level audiences.
Beware: This type of variation will also likely change your ad targeting. For
example, if you target moms with your A/B variant, you need to make sure you
target that same audience with your ads.
Cut the page in half. Less content sometimes means visitors will read more of it.
They're less overwhelmed with information. Try removing everything that isn't
critical. Be hyper concise.
Take a stance. Choose one value prop that you embrace more than competitors.
Build an entire page drawing that line in the sand. In other words, pick a
narrow-minded fight and call out all the competitors who differ from your one, true
way. Show visitors they're either with you or against you, and how being with you
leads to a better outcome. Above, we recommended testing a landing page
focused on our Slack integration.
Combine micro-ideas. We’ve discussed the importance of implementing
macro-variations vs. micro-variations. But a handful of micro-variations, focused
on a singular goal, can be a valuable test. Here are some of the areas of your
page you can test in one variant:
● Text — Header, subheader, feature headers, feature paragraphs
● Imagery — Header image, content images, background images
● CTA — CTA button design, placement, copy.
○ One note on CTAs: if your page is long and informative, don't put the CTA
in the hero section; we want to force visitors to learn more about the
product before clicking through.
○ If the variant is short, it's fine to leave the CTA in the hero section.
● Social proof — Try different quotes or different forms of social proof
● Forms — Number of fields, field layout, and field copy
● Order — The order of your page sections
● Design — Spacing, color, and font styling
● Offers — Introduce a time-sensitive discount
● Modal popups — Entice users to join your mailing list. This makes it easier for
you to educate them—through emails—about your product.
Use one or two of these tactics and you’ll likely see little impact. Change several of
these on your page, and what you have is a macro change. And a better chance of
seeing real impact on your conversion rate.

Phase 3: Choose the best action items
Now that you have a complete table, it’s time to whittle that last column down to the
ideas you want to test.

We share this table with our clients. We ask them to strike out any bullet point from that
last column they don’t want to test (or don’t want to test yet ). You should do the same
with key stakeholders in your organization.

This step saves you considerable time and embarrassment. It's better to know what
your team is comfortable with before you start designing.

Complete & continue

Project: Propose an A/B Test
When pitching A/B tests to our clients as an agency, we gave them an A/B proposal that
highlighted the changes we’d like to make to their page. This gave them the ability to
approve (or deny) certain variants, before we commit too much effort into the actual
changes.

You can, and should, do the same. This allows you to share your ideas with your team.
And allows key stakeholders to provide input before you commit to specific changes on
the page.

You can use our A/B Proposal Template as a starting point.

And here’s what a finished A/B proposal document looks like.

Let’s break down the proposal:

1. Experiment title
You should include at least 2-3 experiments (or variants) in your proposal. That’s
because it’s worth testing a couple of variants at the same time.

Title each experiment with a descriptive name, so you and others know what the
experiment is testing.

2. Explanation
In simple bullet points, explain what the experiment will change about the current
landing page.

3. Reasoning
You want to make sure your A/B ideas are worth testing. There’s no point testing just for
testing sake, when you could invest your time in more worthwhile ventures.

Your reasoning will explain your hypothesis of why these changes should be made. This
is useful both in communicating your motivations to your team and as an exercise in
better thinking through your process.

When your test is done, check your hypotheses against the data; then make new A/B
changes from those learnings.

4. Examples
The remainder of our A/B Proposal Sample features an example of what we believe our
new A/B page might look like.

For our mockup, we used Balsamiq. But we don’t always create mockups this early in
the A/B process. It’s okay to just explain what you think the page might look like if you
haven’t done so already in your Explanation section.

Here are a few examples on how you might describe the proposed changes:

● Use a video for the hero section, and copy like:
○ “Your dog deserves better than retail-quality food”
● Right under the hero section, add 3 columns of testimonials from current
customers.
● Then the rest of the page will be our products. With the ability to add to cart right
from the homepage.
It’s best to come up with 2-4 experiments to pitch to your team so you can pick and
choose the best from each and let your team contrast and compare. Once you decide
which variant(s) you’ll test, implement the A/B changes. That’s what we’ll learn next.

Next Step: Propose A/B Test
Use the template above to propose an A/B test for your company.

Project: Set Up A/B Test
Unfortunately, Google has sunset its free A/B testing tool, Google Optimize.

We used to have detailed step-by-step instructions to do this, but unfortunately, there
are a lot of other options, ranging from $30/mo (Zoho) to many hundreds or thousands,
so it depends on personal preference.

This project will broadly speak on "how to do it" but won't do it step-by-step,
unfortunately.

Prerequisites
● A completed A/B test proposal
● Google Analytics has been set up on your website
● At least 200 visitors to your site a week
NOTE: If Instapage already hosts your current homepage, make an A/B test through
their editor. It will be much easier and much less painful.

Phase 1: Build Your New Landing Page
Phase 1a: Build It
You already built one landing page. Make one to A/B test against, using the proposal
you’ve been building out. Use Instapage or whatever website builder you use.

Phase 1b: DNS records
Log into where you registered your site’s domain name (e.g., Namecheap).

Set up a CNAME record at start.yoursitename.com to point at the new page. (Or ask an
engineer to do it.)

Phase 2: Set up the A/B test tool
This will depend on which tool you choose. But make sure the account is made and
ready to go.

Phase 3: Link to Google Analytics
Make sure you're able to sync up Google Analytics to the page.

Phase 4: Add the Optimize snippet
Add the A/B test code to your site.

Phase 5: Run the experiment
Variants
This will depend on the tool you're using, but this is generally how to do it:

Click “Add Variant.” Name it “Variant 1” or something more descriptive if you’d
like.
Set the “redirect destination” to be the URL you’re using for the new landing page
you want to test, e.g., start.yoursite.com. Hit "Done."
Phase 5c: Measurement and objectives
What's an objective/goal? This is what you want users to do most on your site —
whether it’s clicking the CTA button, signing up, or purchasing.

Make sure it’s early enough in the funnel that many people will do it: you need at least
50 times a week. Otherwise, you won’t get enough data.

A/B testing tools will show the page that performs better: the page where more people
do the thing you want.

Configure that in the tool.

Phase 6: Track events on your variant
page
Skip this section if you've already added tracking on your site (which you should have
done when you built the page).

Ensure that GA and the A/B test tool is accurately tracking your goal event when people
visit your variation page.

Phase 7: Run a sanity test (Optional)
Assuming your site gets under 1,000 visits a day, it’s worth sanity-checking that your
redirect is set up correctly. (It’s notoriously tricky to get right, and lots of teams screw it
up.)

To do that, we'll make a copy of your experiment and temporarily set it to redirect 100%
of your traffic, instead of only 10%. This allows us to test and verify if everything is
working properly manually. We'll then switch the real experiment back on and turn off
the copy.

First, click the 3 dots next to your experiment, and click "Make a copy".
Let's rename the Copy Experiment. Click the three dots in the Draft box, and
name it something like "Sanity Test."
Click the three dots to the far right.
Next, under Settings > Traffic allocation , set it to 100%. Then under Variants
and targeting > Variants , click on " % WEIGHT " next to the variants. Set 90% of
your weight to your Variant, and 10% to the original:
Set the experiment live, then open your site 4-5 times in a bunch of incognito
windows. Most of them should redirect to the new page
As soon as you’ve proven that your test works, turn off the experiment. You can now go
back to your real experiment.

Phase 8: Go Live!
Hit “Start Experiment.” For real this time.

Check out the “Reporting” section of the experiment — this is where your results will
show up.

Measure Paid Traffic Results
Regarding A/B testing, you quickly get diminishing returns on your organic, high-intent
traffic because those visitors already came looking for what you sell. The onus on you
was to affirm you sell what they want and not to scare them off. They were already
primed to convert.

However, with your paid traffic, A/B testing gets you a lot further. These are
medium-intent eyeballs at best — usually people who errantly clicked your ad — and
are, therefore, looking for an excuse to dismiss your value props and bounce from the
page.

If you a/b test very aggressively, you can 5x your conversion rate on paid. Most
companies can do this. We’ve done it for them a half-dozen times in the last several
months.

Here’s one important takeaway: determine a test's success by measuring the
conversion boost mostly on paid traffic. That’s where the delta is large enough to notice
the impact.

If you only assess high-intent organic (non-paid search, referrals, and word of mouth),
you may not even see a bump and might mistakenly dismiss the test as a failure.

Set Reminders
Set a reminder to check back in one, four, and seven days.

1 Day

Make sure events are actually being recorded on each variant. This is the biggest
problem we usually see running A/B tests and it’s totally normal. You might have to
debug issues here.

4 Days

If the new variant is performing significantly worse than your old landing page, turn the
test off. Otherwise, keep waiting.

7 Days, 14 days, etc.

Google will funnel traffic to the highest-performing variant automatically. Check back to
see what’s winning. If one does, have your devs make that the permanent homepage.

How to Find Good Designers and
Developers Without Breaking the Bank
1. Ask friends for referrals
Here’s a template for reaching out:

Hey #{Friend's name}!

We're rebuilding our landing page and I've been tasked with finding a good
designer. Do you happen to know any good visual or UX designers looking for
contract work? Who designed your site?

(Feel free to forward this email to them directly.)

-#{Your name}

2. Use a marketplace site
Designers
Webflow too has a solid vetted pool of designers.

In the instructions you write for these designers, include a link to the landing page copy
you wrote and references to Demand Curve’s successful landing pages. You don't want
them going off-track. They don't know as much about copywriting and conversion as
you now do.

In fact, most designers prioritize aesthetics over UX and conversion potential.

99designs is an upscale Fiverr. You have the option to get designers to submit multiple
designs and compete for your money, so you’ll see many different design approaches at
once.

It will cost you $400-1000 for a decent design.

Krop is new on our radar, but looks interesting.

Dribbble

Find designers whose work you love on Dribbble, and reach out to them. If their email
addresses aren't visible, you'll need to upgrade to a Pro plan to message designers
through the platform.

Developers
When we have too much demand to build a design in-house, we’ll turn to Webflow
developers (since it’s the tool we use). It's a safe suggestion if you don't have
developers of your own. Or if they're slammed with app development work.

Also, we’ve seen success using CodeMentor.

Other marketplaces out there that we don’t have experience with:

● Upwork
● Gun.io
● Toptal

Sites with Free Stock Images

Example (if applicable)

A/B Proposal Sample
Experiment 1. A/B change #1 - The
mission-inspiration-centric approach.
Explanation:
Taking a similar structural approach to Natural Force.

● Focus first on mission of Equip, in the hero section.
● Design LP with lifestyle-image-heavy layout for products.
● Cut out the other copy that’s not directly related to the product or mission
Reason:

● The mission of Equip can help the brand stand apart from ‘other’ supplements. And
provides transparency and personality to the brand. Thus improves the trust factor. Also
coincides with our findings from our heat map analysis, where user behavior led us to
believe it worth running an A/B where products are further down the page so people
learn more about Equip before clicking to a product.
○ While not necessary for this initial test, it’d be worth making a CTA in this hero
section that clicks on to a mission landing page or about page, so those who are
interested can really learn more about the company (and from there products are
featured naturally, so that the ability to convert remains just one click away).
● The use of the ‘right’ lifestyle images can lead to a stronger connection between visitors
and the benefits of Equip. Vs. just showing the products.
○ It can show them ‘ah, this is how/why equip fits into my life’
Example:

Experiment 2. A/B change #3: Make primary
focus on what’s wrong with the status quo
Explanation:

● We make an argument about the issues with ‘the other guys’ but we do so further down
the page. With some copy alterations, and a new section or two, we can restructure the
current page to focus first on these status quo issues. So that the narrative is:
○ This is the problem you face/or will face (supplements loaded with crap)
○ This is why it’s such a problem (crap is bad for your body, for many reasons -
stats/research here would be great)
○ Equip was made to save you from this crap (think ‘mission of equip’)
○ How Equip differs from competitors, cta to products
○ How we help you get your daily dose of nutrients, naturally
Reason:

● Worth testing what the mindset of the visitors are. Are they in the camp of ‘I’m tired of
crap found elsewhere. And I want someone to call them out”? If so, then this page would
resonate with them.
○ And it would for folks who are like “Equip sounds good, but I could probably get
that crap at Walmart or GNC, right?”
Example (very loose example, as we’d build it out more and refine the copy to make it more
appropriate. For the example we grabbed existing assets from the website only to demonstrate
the five bullet points above). Note that the numbered comments are saying what the section
would talk about, not the specific image they may be sitting on.

Project: User Survey
Product surveys provide us data about each of our customer segments. We use this
data to create actionable items for acquisition strategies. For example, we can target
better on ad channels and write compelling copy for landing pages.

Phase 0: Setup
Start a blank document (in Dropbox Paper or Google Docs).

Phase 1: Figure out incentives
We find that offering some form of incentive to would-be responders helps with the
following:

● Receiving an adequate number of responses
○ Without an incentive, many people will ignore the email because there’s
nothing in it for them.
● Receiving higher quality responses
○ A free survey will mostly attract bored people. Highly-skilled people like
designers will often not bother to respond unless they really love or hate
the product. The incentive helps attract people across levels of
engagement.
● A boost in sign ups/revenue
○ If the incentive is tied to some sort of a product discount (instead of flat
cash) it can lead to increased sales as the survey reminds people you
exist and engages them further (and helps pitch why the product is worth
trying).
● Improving or saving brand image
○ Asking for something without offering something back often leaves a
negative sentiment in the asked party. By offering something in return
you’re showing you respect their time and effort, even if they don’t decide
to take you up on the offer.
For B2B products, avoid plan upgrades as incentives in surveys.

Upgrades don’t incentivize businesses well since businesses don’t care about saving a
few bucks, across the business; they generally care about having their time saved and
giant dollar amounts.

Instead, the trick is to use Amazon gift cards: then, the person answering the survey
gets to keep that selfishly for themselves (very compelling) as opposed to save a few
bucks for the business they work for.

Ideally, offer at least $25 worth of credit to get good response rates.

Write down your chosen incentive, along with two backup alternatives, into your doc,
under a section called “Incentives”.

Phase 2: Figure out the audiences
Common segments include:

● Leads
● Free users
● Users at different priced plans
● Customers (for products with one-time purchase)
● Users who churned (used your product and left)
● Users who never came back to the site
Actually go in and make sure you can actually get these lists of users with their email
address; this has been a difficult task for some clients, since there’s sometimes work
involved to figure out ways to create these lists.

Then, add them to your doc under a section called “Audiences”.

Phase 3: Figure out mechanics
Ask yourself the following questions:

● What is your budget/discount to offer incentives for the survey?
○ We always aim to have a minimum of 100 responses. Work with any
budget you can allocate to make that happen.
● Do you have customer personas written somewhere?
○ Get those ready.
● Do you already use a messaging platform (such as MailChimp or Intercom) that
you can use to send the emails to customers to introduce the surveys?
○ If not, sign up for one of those two.
● Do you already use a survey platform (such as Survey Monkey)?
○ If not, sign up for Survey Monkey. We’ve written step-by-step instructions
on how to set up surveys using it (you’ll see these soon).
● Are there any specifics you'd personally like to gather from this survey?
Add these questions, along with your answers, to your doc under a section called “Initial
Questions”.

Phase 4: Come up with questions
For each audience, create your survey questions. Here’s an example.

Add them to your doc under a section called “Survey Questions”.

Phase 5: Write Survey Email
Craft an email to be sent to potential respondents. Check out User Surveys – Additional
Resources > Template: Survey Email Outreach for templates to use.

Add them to your doc under a section called “Survey Email”.

Phase 6: Set up Survey
Port surveys from your doc to the survey platform (Survey Monkey). See User Surveys

Additional Resources > Survey Monkey Surveys on step-by-step instructions on how.
Then check for typos on the survey preview.

Phase 7: Send Surveys
Phase 7a: Build contact lists on the email platform.
Now, go onto MailChimp/Intercom/etc. and actually create the contact lists for each
segment.

Build contact lists for each segment on your email/messaging platform.

Phase 7b: Build live email
On MailChimp/etc., copy-paste in the email that will go live from your survey report doc.

Do one last passthrough for typos and make sure the email and the audience match up.

Phase 7c: Test
Test it first! Send the email and survey to yourself and a team member. Click on
everything and fill it out.

Make sure there are no crazy errors.

Phase 7d:
Go live!

Hit send.

Set a reminder to switch the survey off in a week. We like to use Slack to create
reminders, but a calendar event will work too.

Create a reminder in 3 days to check the survey, and another to close the survey after a
week.

Phase 7e:
Follow-up checks

Check on the reminders.

Keep an eye throughout the first few days for email open rates and survey response
rates. If a survey is not performing well, send a reminder email as a new thread to
encourage more responses.

● Use the same email template
● Use a different subject line to encourage immediate action
Reminder: [[old subject line]]
3 days left to give us your feedback
Phase 7f: Follow up on incentives for users
If there’s an incentive, log into your survey tool and pull the email list of who responded.
Send the gift cards/cash/etc.

Phase 8: Collect Results
Let surveys run for at least 7 days.

Then, go through the results. See if you can draw meaningful conclusions from them
(see phase 9).

Phase 9: Summarize Suggestions and
Actionable Insights in Final Report
This is something most agencies do to present to clients. It helps you pitch the rest of
your company on changes you want to make — so they understand the data behind
your recommendations.

After individual reports are done, we collect action items, insights, and suggestions in a
single report. This document is focused on goals, and the insights we collected
from surveys.

[[Customer Name]]: Insights from Surveys

Structure the document in the way shown in this template (you may need to make a
different document for each survey if the results are quite different).

Phase 10: Generally applicable feedback
Keep these in mind when coming up with insights and
conclusions for surveys.
Come up with a conclusion that brings it all together and briefly
summarizes the biggest lessons learned.

● This summary should come at the top of the document, so it can be easily
referenced at a later date.
● When doing this, continue thinking of the larger implications of what you’re
suggesting, and try to tie larger ideas back together.
Not every question will yield meaningful conclusions. And some questions might yield
multiple conclusions. So, whenever there’s an opportunity for insights, come up
with them.

Be as specific and as descriptive as possible with your suggested insights
as possible.

● If you’re recommending a referral program to be put in place, how would this
referral program be set up?
○ Incentives
○ Audience
○ Technical requirements
■ Thinking through these things is a thought exercise that makes you
realize the true relevance and feasibility of your suggestions.
● If you’re recommending content creation, suggest the type of content that should
be created. And provide the reference data to back up the suggestion.
When including direct quotes from open-ended responses, make it clear
that they are quotes.

● Include quotation marks around individual quotes.
● Create a table to group large numbers of quotes
Make sure what you’re saying is extra clear.

Write out the obvious, and don’t expect the reader to make any necessary logic jumps.

● There’s a lot of material presented in survey docs. They’re very prone to
skimming.
● Always finish your thoughts. Don’t assume people will piece together the dots
about what you’re implying.
When you’ve identified the value propositions that users care about, use
that insight to analyze what you currently have for Ad and Landing Page

copy.

● Value propositions usually clearly identified with the question: Which use cases
make [[ product ]] most valuable to you? These value propositions are the ones
we need to communicate to audiences in ad and landing pages.
● Analyze your Landing Pages to see how well those value propositions are
communicated.
● For Ads
○ Identify if current ad copy hits these value propositions.
○ How should ad copy change in response to these value propositions?
○ What other new ad copy can we test from these value propositions?
When you’ve identified the most valuable features of a service/tool, or the
most valuable characteristics of a product, use that insight to structure
Drip Message Flows.

This insight usually comes from the question: Which feature in [[ product ]] do you value
most?

● These are particularly important for Post Sign Up Message Flows sent to new
users. Because once users experience these features, they will better
understand the value provided by the product/service/tool.
Focus on frequent answers.

Some of the open-ended questions with long text responses will give you interesting
insights. But be wary about acting on the opinions of one person. Maybe they’re not
your target market. Maybe they wouldn’t be happy or buy from you even if you
implemented their recommendations. Maybe they just want to complain.

Base your insights off of a wide range of people. If 50 people are saying something, you
should definitely pay attention.

Growth Program: Example Survey Insights
— UX Tool
This is a summary of insights from surveys to Paying and Free Users. It’s meant to be an
easy-to-reference document, so that we can use these insights moving forward.

Audience Targeting
Target these user and firm profiles in applicable ad channels
Firmographic Profile

All paying users surveyed use the tool as a part of a team. Their team size (not company size) is
either small (1-5 people) or fairly large (21-50 people).

Of free users, only 12% work independently. The remaining 88% are also part of a company
team, but with smaller team sizes (69% work in teams with up to 10 people).

This should inform our ad targeting and cold email prospecting: We know we need to reach the
decision-makers in product development and engineering teams in larger companies (that have
dev teams of 21-50 people).

Professional Roles

The roles we should be primarily targeting are:

● Product Managers
● Engineers
● Devops
Most notably, more paying users were in product management than free users. Therefore we
should be open to targeting product managers if we want to skew toward accounts that wind up
converting to paid.

Build out a landing page for an audience in product management.
Keep in mind

Most users (73%) did not use a competing platform before finding out about the tool. This
indicates that ads need to educate the target audience that this is solution that they can
seek out in the first place.

● 35% did not amplify their UX at all prior to using the tool — they haven’t been motivated
to or didn’t even realize they should
● 38% amplified their UX manually, using a combination of tools and techniques, without
using a platform specifically built for UX amplification — this is cumbersome but they
may have not known a solution like our tool existed.
Note: 27% of paying users have tried a variety of competing platforms, usually in combination
with one another. That’s not insignificant. Therefore:

● We must begin doing competitive analysis: We must look at those platforms to
see where they fall short, to understand what drove users away from them.
● We should better highlight the contrast: how our tool saves them time and money
by offering a complete solution, where the alternative would be to have them use
multiple platforms with increased set up time.
Copy
Update copy in LP, ads, and messaging to reflect main value propositions that led users
to sign up for our tool.
Copy priority should reflect the following value propositions:

Speed: Get new designs with quick turn-around time.

Our tool allows for the design process to move along quickly and not stall between stages.

Accuracy: Validate UX amplifications with real professionals backing them.
Our tool allows UX amplification with certified professionals, instead of individual unqualified
opinions that are likely not representative of good UX.

Ease: Amplify UX with easy-to-recruit contractors.
Our tool enables you to find someone to amplify your UX in seconds. Ease of recruiting
contractors from our vetted panel allows UX amplification to be more easily accessible to teams
of all sizes and budgets.

Drip Messages
We need to solve the issue of users not being fully informed.

Reinforce the existence of paid plans (and their benefits) to Free Users with messaging.
17% of users were not aware that our tool offered paid plans. Messages should be
delivered in-app every X times a Free User amplifies their UX, and via email at a less frequent
rate.

Remind users of bulk-buying discounts for Contractor Recruitment
Messaging should also highlight the fact that there are bulk-buying discounts applied to
contractor recruitment. (This was a product feature some users mentioned they wanted to see,
but already exists, which indicates that they are not well informed.)

Encourage Free Users and new users to do a Basic UX Amplification within the first 7
days from sign up. Because once they get a taste of them, they want to upgrade.
Ad Targeting

What’s keeping Free Users from
converting
17% of free users were not aware that our tool offered paid plans. (We’re tackling this with
Messaging). Another 8% of free users are not certain what are the benefits associated with the
added benefits of a paid plan.

What if we gave all new free users the chance to try out each of the paid-only UX
Amplification types once? This could be offered as they become more familiar with our
tool, after running X number of amplifications or after recruiting an X number of
contractors from our pool.
17% of free users declared to not be in a position within their company or team to make a
purchasing decision.

How can we facilitate the conversation that needs to happen between decision makers
and the end users for UX Amplification?
General Product Suggestions
Specific suggestions for improvements to the contractor panel include:

Ability to segment the panel with finer demographics
Less developers and techies, more designers
● More information on how contractors are recruited and vetted, giving users greater
confidence in the quality of the contractor pool
a. We should add this to the landing page copy
b. We should break panel recruitment down by job type
For Reference
I wanted to leave this question here because I thought it was quite insightful.

If you no longer had access to our tool, what would you
use instead?
A mix of other tools — 54 responses, 39%
I don’t know — 40 responses, 29%
Manual amplification — 25 responses, 18%

39% of free users are confident they would be able to find a suitable solution to replace
our tool — even if that means having to use multiple services / tools to do what they could do
using only our tool.

One way to leverage this is to demonstrate how much time and money our tool saves its users
by offering a complete solution from a single platform.

In contrast, a lot of the free users expressed concern at the thought of not having access to our
tool anymore. A significant portion even mentioned they would not know how to replace our tool
in their design and development workflow.

How can we leverage this? How can we create scarcity? How can we compel people to
pay?
