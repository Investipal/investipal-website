# Master Keyword Research — US

Authoritative index for all keyword assets. Update here first; downstream docs should reference this file.

## Datasets
- Keyword universe (metrics + annotations): `./keywords/keyword-universe.csv`
- Cluster metrics: `./keywords/clusters.csv`
- Page mapping: `./keywords/pages-map.csv`
- Gaps list: `./keywords/queries-missing-coverage.csv`

## Summaries
- Executive summary: `./keywords-summary.md`
- Full write-up with pillars and prioritization: `./keyword-research-us.md`
- Top clusters and first 10 briefs: `./top-clusters-and-briefs.md`

## Pillars (US/en)
- IPS, Brokerage Statements, Held‑away Assets, Reg BI, RIA Software, Portfolio Optimization, Proposal Generation, Onboarding & Account Opening

## Governance
- Update CSVs first → refresh summaries → align landing-page-strategy mappings.
- Capture sources for new terms (DFSEO pulls): date, endpoint, parameters.
- Demand Curve alignment: content should open with a clear promise, deliver fast answers, and back claims with examples/templates or data; maintain one primary CTA per piece.
