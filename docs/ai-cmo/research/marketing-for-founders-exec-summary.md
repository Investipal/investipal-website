# Marketing for Founders — 1‑Page Executive Summary

This 1‑pager distills the most actionable concepts from the Marketing‑for‑Founders repository to help early‑stage SaaS/app/startup teams get their first 10/100/1000 users quickly, with minimal budget. Citations reference the strongest canonical sources in each area.

## What works universally
- Founder‑led distribution: Share progress, lessons, and product updates on your personal channels. It compounds trust and reach over time. See “building in public” playbooks ([Failory](https://www.failory.com/blog/building-in-public), [Founder‑led LinkedIn](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/founder-led-linkedin-guide)).
- Talk to users early and often: Treat discovery, interviews, and surveys as a core loop to validate ICP, positioning, content, and pricing ([Superhuman PMF engine](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/), [Interview scripts](https://deployempathy.substack.com/p/customer-interview-script-discovery-phase-i-e-before-you-ve-built-anything-415336)).
- Prove demand before scaling: Sequence channels—start with direct outreach and distribution, then content/email, then SEO/LLM SEO, then paid as an accelerant ([Startup sales strategy](https://posthog.com/founders/startup-sales-strategy), [SaaS SEO guide](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/the-saas-seo-guide)).
- Publish value, not ads: Content and free tools attract, educate, and convert; reuse across social, communities, and email ([Content strategy](https://newsletter.mkt1.co/p/mkt1-content-strategy-part-1), [Free‑tool marketing](https://www.marketingideas.com/p/mini-tools-are-10x-more-powerful)).
- Optimize for AI discovery: Structure entities, proof, and category signals so LLMs surface you in answers ([AEO guide](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-aeo-ethan-smith), [AI search playbook](https://knowledge.gtmstrategist.com/p/how-to-win-the-new-seo-game-ai-search)).

## Practical sequencing (first 90–180 days)
1) Weeks 0‑2: Nail the earliest customer profile; run 10–20 discovery calls; stand up founder‑led social; draft a compelling homepage and value prop ([ICP framework](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/framework-ideal-customer-profile), [Positioning quickstart](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/positioning)).
2) Weeks 2‑6: Outbound for learning and first logos (email/DM/LI); ship onboarding emails; publish 2–4 narrative posts; test one mini free tool ([Outbound playbook](https://knowledge.gtmstrategist.com/p/the-gtm-outreach-playbook-from-triggers-to-demos), [Onboarding flows](https://posthog.com/blog/how-we-built-email-onboarding)).
3) Weeks 6‑12: Content distribution system; launch on 1–2 platforms/directories; set up social listening; seed Reddit with non‑promo stories ([Places to launch](https://github.com/EdoStra/Marketing-for-Founders?tab=readme-ov-file#-places-to-launch-your-startup), [Social listening](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/social-listening-guide), [Reddit guide](https://redreach.ai/reddit-marketing-guide)).
4) Months 3‑6: Build programmatic/UGC‑oriented SEO; implement AEO checklists; experiment with a narrow paid test (retargeting/BOFU) ([Use‑case‑led SEO](https://playbooks.hypergrowthpartners.com/p/use-case-led-seo-a-strategy-for-organic), [Programmatic SEO](https://playbooks.hypergrowthpartners.com/p/ai-powered-programmatic-seo), [LLM/AEO](https://vercel.com/blog/how-were-adapting-seo-for-llms-and-ai-search)).

## KPIs by stage (examples)
- Problem/solution fit: # discovery calls/week; % problem acknowledgment; top 3 JTBD validated
- Early traction: Reply rate (cold/email/DM), booked calls, first‑to‑paid conversion, WAU/MAU
- Content/distribution: Publishing cadence, content‑to‑demo rate, email subscribers and activation
- SEO/LLM SEO: Pages indexed, referring domains, AEO inclusion (mentions in AI answers), share of semantics
- Paid: CAC payback expectations (test), CTR/CVR per audience, retargeting ROAS

## Anti‑patterns to avoid
- Scaling paid before message‑market fit; turning on broad search/social too early
- Promo‑heavy Reddit or communities; link‑dropping without narrative
- SEO content mills with no distribution or links; programmatic pages without usefulness
- Over‑custom pricing with unclear value metrics; no social proof on core pages
