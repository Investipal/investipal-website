# Demand Curve Growth Marketing Course — Deep Brief

Source: `docs/ai-cmo/research/demand-curve-growth-marketing-course.pdf`

## 1) Strategy Foundations
- Ideal Customer Profile (ICP): define 1–2 narrow segments; map pains, triggers, and alternatives.
- Value Proposition: outcome-first; articulate why-now and why-better vs status quo.
- Channel–Model Fit: select channels where your ICP already has motivation and purchase context.
- Growth Model: specify core loop(s) (content, paid, product, referral) and supporting loops.

## 2) Research & Message-Market Fit
- Qualitative: 10–20 interviews; objections, decision criteria, vocabulary. Synthesize JTBD and triggers.
- Quantitative: baseline funnel, diagnostics (drop-offs, time-to-value, activation rate).
- Positioning: who/what/why-better proofed with specific outcomes and social proof.

## 3) Offer & Landing Pages
- Above the fold: who it’s for, problem, outcome, strongest proof, primary CTA.
- Mid-page: mechanism, key features mapped to outcomes, comparisons, FAQs.
- Pricing: value metric aligned with usage/outcomes; friction-lowering guarantees; annual plan framing.
- CRO: prioritize message–offer–proof over cosmetic tweaks; test one change per page section.

## 4) Onboarding & Lifecycle Email
- Goal: compress time-to-value; guide first-success action(s).
- Lifecycle flows: welcome, activation nudges, objection handlers, expansion, win-back.
- Instrumentation: event-based triggers; suppress redundancy; measure reply rate + activation lift.

## 5) Content & SEO
- Editorial strategy: problem narratives, teardown case studies, practical templates.
- Distribution: define channels, angles, and cadence; repurpose pillars → clips, threads, emails.
- SEO: use-case/intent clusters; internal linking; supporting tools for backlinks and authority.
- LLM/AEO: entity clarity, evidence, and authority signals for AI answer inclusion.

## 6) Paid Acquisition (Search, Social, Retargeting)
- Readiness: clear offer + converting landing page; track CAC, payback, LTV.
- Audiences: BOFU first (retargeting/competitors/intents), then MOFU, then TOFU cautiously.
- Creative testing: hypothesis-driven variations (angle, benefit, proof, CTA); isolate variables.
- Budgets: small weekly caps per audience; kill/scale rules based on statistical thresholds.
- Search: high-intent queries; exact/Phrase; negatives; tailored pages per theme.
- Social: thumb-stopping creative; narrative-first; symptom → outcome framing.

## 7) Experimentation System
- Backlog: hypotheses tied to constraints (awareness, desirability, usability, viability).
- Prioritization: ICE/PIE with evidence; weekly planning; owner + success metric.
- Cadence: ship small, learn fast; archive learnings in a decision log.
- Guardrails: track base conversion, revenue, and key user experience metrics.

## 8) Measurement & Economics
- KPIs by stage: discovery calls, activation rate, content→demo rate, CAC payback, LTV/CAC.
- Attribution: use blended + directional channel metrics; avoid overfitting last-click.
- Financial model: scenario CAC, paid mix, ramp time, profit constraints.

## 9) Partnerships, Influencers, Affiliates
- Criteria: audience–problem match; authenticity; proof assets.
- Activation: co-created content, demos, and offers; attribution and payouts.
- Referrals: simple rules, fast rewards, clear shareable benefit.

## 10) Operating Rhythm
- Weekly: experiment review, pipeline grooming, creative sync.
- Monthly: channel deep dives, cost curve review, positioning refresh as needed.
- Quarterly: growth model audit; re-validate ICP; prune underperforming loops.

## Checklists & Templates
- ICP one-sheet; Value Proposition worksheet; Message map; Landing checklist; Email flow map; Experiment brief; Paid creative matrix; Attribution worksheet.

## Risks & Anti-patterns
- Scaling paid before message-market fit.
- Content without distribution or POV; SEO without usefulness.
- Overcomplicated pricing; proof buried below the fold.
- Testing too many variables; conflating experiments.

## Implementation Notes for Investipal
- Start with founder-led distribution; publish weekly problem narratives for advisors.
- Prioritize activation email flows; add guided first-success action.
- Build 1–2 micro tools for backlinks and qualified discovery.
- Launch retargeting + BOFU search after landing conversion is proven.
